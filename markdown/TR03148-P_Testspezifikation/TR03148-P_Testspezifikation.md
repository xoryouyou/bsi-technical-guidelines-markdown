# <span id="page-4-2"></span>1 Introduction

The Technical Guideline [BSI TR-03148] specifies the requirements for a secure Broadband Router. The current document extends [BSI TR-03148] by defining conformity criteria for broadband routers and specifying tests which verify that the provided interfaces and functionalities fulfill the requirements defined in the referenced Technical Guideline.

### <span id="page-4-1"></span>1.1 Structure of this Document

The document is structured as follows: The first Section contains an introduction, basic definitions and this description of the structure of the document. In Section 2 the requirements of the test environment are described. Section 3 defines the implementation conformance statement (ICS). The ICS specifies information the applicant has to provide in order to apply for a conformity test. The test cases that are to be performed by the tester are defined in Section 4.

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>1.2 Definitions

This Section defines terms and abbreviations that will be used frequently in this Test Specification.

## <span id="page-31-0"></span>4 Test Cases

This Section defines test cases by referring to a Test Requirement defined in [BSI TR-03148] and defining a Test Procedure to verify conformance to the corresponding requirement. The requirements and procedures are labeled using the following scheme:

TR.[Module].[RequirementNumber] = Test **Requirement** [BSI TR-03148]

TP.[Module].[RequirementNumber].[TestNumber] = Test **Procedure**

#### **Rating of Test Requirements and Test Procedures**

| PASS           | Test evidence does support the assertions of the applicant and/ or manufacturer. The<br>tests performed by the tester demonstrate that the respective Test Procedure is fulfilled.<br>The tester considered all aspects of the Criteria to PASS.                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| FAIL           | One single aspect of a Test Procedure fails or could not be verified. Therefore the<br>complete Test Procedure and the respective Test Requirement is rated FAIL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |
| INCONCLUSIVE   | This test verdict is given when the test result is such that neither a PASS nor a FAIL verdict<br>can be given. For example: the tester needs further details of the implementation (e.g.<br>documentation, source code, special test setup) to finalize his assessment but did not<br>receive these details from the applicant or manufacturer.                                                                                             |  |
| NOT APPLICABLE | The tester is able to follow the argumentation of the applicant and/ or manufacturer that<br>the respective Test Requirement is not relevant for the specific implementation of the<br>DUT. In this case the tester MUST provide a detailed analysis and argumentation to<br>support the rating. If the DUT does not support features which MAY be implemented the<br>explanation might be short (e.g. DUT does not support community WLAN). |  |

#### **Functional Testing**

Test Procedures (TP.[Module].[TestNumber]) that are described with formulations like "the tester performs functional testing" or "by functional testing" do not explicitly require specific test tools and test steps using these tools. It is up to the tester to use his/ her expertise and tools to validate conformance to the specific Test Procedures. The test report MUST detail the used tools and the specific functional tests the tester performed. The test evidence MUST be provided.

#### **Remark concerning the DUTs state** *initialized*

Several Test Procedures require testing in the *initialized* state. While performing several of those tests the DUT may more and more change to the *customized* state. It is important that the tester is convinced that the DUT is in the *initialized* state if required for testing. If previous tests could have an impact on further testing in the *initialized* state the tester MUST reset the DUT to *factory setting* and perform a new initialization to change to *initialized* again. The tester MUST verify that after resetting the DUT to *factory setting* the DUT is configured as by delivery by the applicant (e.g. firmware version, configuration).

#### **Keywords**

Both the Technical Guideline (BSI TR-03148) and this Test Specification make use of the following keywords as defined in [IETF RFC 2119]. The keywords "CONDITIONAL" and "IF" mean that the usage of an item is dependent on the usage of other items. It is therefore further qualified under which conditions the item is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED.

Some notes provide further clarification for the testers.

*Table 26: Keywords*

### <span id="page-33-0"></span>4.1 Module A - Private Network

#### **TR.A.1 A DUT MUST offer a Local Area Network (LAN) or WLAN interface to offer access to the Internet for the local user devices in the private network.**

<span id="page-33-1"></span>TP.A.1.1 The tester verifies the assertions of the applicant given in Table [6](#page-21-3), [Private Network](#page-21-3) [Interfaces and services of the DUT,](#page-21-3) to be consistent with the user guidance.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the tester is able to verify that the information given in Table [6, Private Network Interfaces and services of the DUT](#page-21-3), is consistent with the user guidance.

<span id="page-33-2"></span>TP.A.1.2 Following the user guidance the tester sets the DUT into operation by changing the DUTs state from *factory setting* to *initialized*.

> If more than one procedure is available to set the DUT into operation all procedures MUST be verified (e.g. web interface, mobile app, telnet, ssh).

> If the procedure of setting the DUT into operation is not consistent with the procedure described in the user guidance this MUST be addressed in the test report.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the procedure of setting the DUT into operation is consistent with the procedure described in the user guidance.

TP.A.1.3 The tester verifies in *initialized* state for each identified interface of the private network offering access to the Internet the basic functionality.

> The local user device (e.g. test system) in the private network segment MUST have full internet access.

> Implementations, where the offered access to the Internet is limited in *initialized* state but full internet access could be permitted by a configuration option of the DUT are acceptable. In this case the test must be performed with enabled full internet access for the respective interface of the private network.

> The tester verifies this Test Procedure by functional testing using typical internet protocols like IPv4, IPv6 or ICMP. In addition the internet access is verified by using typical application layer protocols like DNS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), SSH (Secure Shell) and/ or Telnet.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the tester could not find any limitations of the internet access according to the tests specified above. Each identified interface of the private network offering access to the Internet must be assessed.

#### **TR.A.2 In** *factory setting* **the DUT SHOULD restrict access to a defined list of services provided to devices connected on the LAN and WLAN interface by the DUT.**

<span id="page-34-0"></span>TP.A.2.1 Following [TP.A.1.1](#page-33-1) the tester summarizes for each identified interface of the **private network** all services provided by the DUT in *factory setting*. The tester verifies this to be consistent with the user guidance.

This Test Procedure depends on the DUTs state *factory setting*.

The services are provided on one or more dedicated TCP and/ or UDP ports or by the network stack itself.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the list of services provided by the DUT in factory setting to devices connected on the LAN and WLAN interface is a defined listing. This list MUST be consistent with the user guidance.

TP.A.2.2 In *factory setting* the tester performs service/ port scans for each identified interface of the **private network** to identify services offered by the DUT.

This Test Procedure depends on the DUTs state *factory setting*.

These scans MUST include techniques to detect protocols of the Internet layer, Transport layer and Application layer.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the results of the service/ port scans are consistent with the results of [TP.A.2.1](#page-34-0) for the *factory setting* state.

#### **TR.A.3 Only a minimal selection of services SHOULD be available on the LAN and WLAN interface of the DUT.**

<span id="page-34-1"></span>TP.A.3.1 Following [TP.A.1.1](#page-33-1) the tester summarizes for each identified interface of the private network all services provided by the DUT in all states. The tester verifies this to be consistent with the user guidance.

> The services are provided on one or more dedicated TCP and/ or UDP ports or by the network stack itself.

> An example of a list of minimal services may be found in [TR-03148], Table 3, Common services offered to the private network by the router. They are needed for the Internet gateway and network management functionality of the DUT. They allow the connected user devices to access the Internet through the DUT and to communicate with one another.

> Services which SHOULD NOT be available on the DUTs interfaces of the private network in *factory setting* or *initialized* are for example the services for FTP, Mailserver, Mediaserver, NAS (network attached storage), Printserver, Remote Control, Smart Home or VPN.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the list of all services provided by the DUT in all states is minimal. This list MUST be consistent with the user guidance.

TP.A.3.2 In *initialized* the tester performs service/ port scans for each identified interface of the private network to identify services offered by the DUT.

> These scans MUST include techniques to detect protocols of the Internet layer, Transport layer and Application layer.

To identify services for filesharing the tester has to connect an USB MSD (mass storage device) and an USB printer to the DUT before booting the device. Some implementations do not start filesharing services without detection of such devices during system start.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the results of the service/ port scans are consistent with the results of [TP.A.3.1](#page-34-1) for the *initialized* state.

#### **TR.A.4 All services provided by the DUT MUST be documented by the manufacturer including the port(s) or port ranges used.**

- <span id="page-35-0"></span>TP.A.4.1 The tester verifies the assertions of the applicant for the services and client software of the DUT for the **private network** given in
	- Table [6, Private Network Interfaces and services of the DUT](#page-21-3) and
	- Table [7, Private Network Interfaces and client software of the DUT](#page-21-6)

to be consistent with the user guidance.

This Test Procedure does not depend on the DUTs state.

It is recommended to complete this Test Procedure at the end of the DUT's assessment. In doing so the tester is more familiar with the services provided by the DUT.

The documentation in the user guidance MUST include the port(s) or port ranges of the services. In addition the client services SHOULD be documented. All service and client software implementations are in focus.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the tester found no inconsistencies between the user guidance and the ICS (in detail Table [6](#page-21-3) and [7](#page-21-6)).

TP.A.4.2 The tester verifies that the list of services and client software of the DUT for the **private network** is consistent with the documentation.

This Test Procedure does not depend on the DUTs state.

It is recommended to complete this Test Procedure at the end of the DUT's assessment. In doing so the tester is more familiar with the services provided by the DUT.

The assessment MUST include the port(s) or port ranges of the services. In addition the client services SHOULD be part of the test. All service and client software implementations are in focus.

When performing all the Test Procedures the tester creates a list of all services and client software including the port(s) or port ranges of the services. This list represents the implementation of the DUT verified by the tester. Services and client software identified during testing are noted in this list by the tester.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the tester found no inconsistencies between the implementation and the user guidance. The list of services and client software created by the tester MUST be consistent with the user guidance.

#### **TR.A.5 If one of the service offered by the DUT is deactivated during operation of the DUT the corresponding port(s) MUST be closed.**

TP.A.5.1 The tester verifies by functional testing for each service offered by the DUT for the **private network** that the corresponding port(s) is/ are closed as soon as the corresponding service is deactivated.

This Test Procedure does not depend on the DUTs state.

Open ports can be detected by port scanners (e.g. nmap, ICMP port unreachable message). To verify services based on connection-less protocols the tester could also use port scanners for well-known applications but could also use the application of the sender trying to re-connect to the DUT. If a re-connection is not possible the connection-less service of the DUT seems to be deactivated. This MUST always be verified by sniffing and analyzing the communication (e.g. tcpdump, wireshark) between sender and DUT during such a re-connection attempt.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if no port(s) of a corresponding service offered by the DUT is detectable after this service is deactivated. All services offered by the DUT are in focus.

This Test Procedure depends on the DUTs states *initialized* and *customized*.

The tester performs functional testing of the implemented firewall functionality in *initialized*. To monitor and configure the DUTs firewall functionality the tester uses the access methods listed in Section [3.6](#page-24-0), Table [13](#page-24-2), to configure the DUT.

Test setup: One test system is used in each private network segment (private WLAN, private LAN) and one test system in the public network (Internet, e.g. test system with public IP address). Each test system is capable to send IP Packets (e.g. telnet client, web browser, port scanner like nmap) and to sniff the local network segment using a network sniffer (e.g. tcpdump, wireshark). A network tap could be used to support testing. If the DUT provides several private network segments the tests could be performed in series using two test systems.

Using this test setup the tester verifies for the IP protocols ICMP, TCP (e.g. http) and UDP (e.g. DNS) sent between the test systems in the private network segments and the test system in the Internet that the DUTs firewall is able to monitor (log) and control (filter) these connections. The tester verifies that the DUTs firewall contains a packet filter based on stateful packet inspection.

The monitor (log) feature MUST include details like source IP address/ MAC, destination IP address/ MAC, source port, destination port, a timestamp and a reference to the firewall rule responsible for this specific log event.

The control (filter) feature MUST include the options to allow (accept, enable) or to

forbid (decline, disable) single connections based on the source IP address/ MAC, destination IP address/ MAC, source port, destination port and the connection type (new, established, related).

Monitoring (log) and controlling (filter) of the test system in the public network (Internet) is only based on the test systems IP address due to the fact that the MAC address of this test system is changed by the public router(s) involved.

To verify that the implemented packet filter is based on a stateful packet inspection the tester analyses the necessary firewall rules for IP connections. In case of a stateful packet inspection the necessary rules can analyze the connection type (new, established, related) and typically an IP connection between two network segments requires two rules: one outgoing rule for new connections and one rule accepting all established and related connections.

#### *Criteria to Pass*

This Test Procedure is successfully passed, if the tester is able monitor (log) and control (filter) different IP connections between the test systems in the private network segment(s) and the Internet using the DUTs firewall functionality based on a packet filter containing a stateful packet inspection.

*Table 29: Abbreviations*

<span id="page-104-0"></span>5 "Wi-Fi Simple Configuration" (WSC) refers to the protocol version 2 (WSC2), certified in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup program (WPS). Early in 2006 the "Wi-Fi Protected Setup", shortcut also WPS, refers to the former version 1 of the WSC protocol. The acronym WPS is still commonly used to refer to the connection techniques like WPS PIN, WPS push button or WPS NFC specified in the WSC protocol. In this test specification WSC/ WSC2 is used to refer to the protocol in general and WPS PIN, WPS push button or WPS NFC to refer to the connection techniques (specified in the WSC protocol).
