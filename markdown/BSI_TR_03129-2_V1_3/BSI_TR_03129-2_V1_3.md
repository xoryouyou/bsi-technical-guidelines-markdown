## <span id="page-3-0"></span>1 Introduction

This technical guideline, referenced as BSI-TR-03129-2, specifies PKI-related communication protocols for security mechanisms in the context of machine readable travel documents (MRTD). This document supplements BSI-TR-03129 with regard to document checks for public and official authorities.

#### 1.1 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

The key word "CONDITIONAL" is to be interpreted as follows: The usage of an item depends on the use of other items. It is therefore further qualified under which conditions the item is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED.

| Parameter            | Meaning     |  |  |  |
|----------------------|-------------|--|--|--|
| MUST / SHALL         | REQUIRED    |  |  |  |
| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT | -           |  |  |  |
| SHOULD               | RECOMMENDED |  |  |  |
| MAY                  | OPTIONAL    |  |  |  |
| -                    | CONDITIONAL |  |  |  |

*Table 1: Key words*

## <span id="page-4-0"></span>2 Implemenation as Web Services

### 2.1 Web Service using SOAP messages

All protocols must be implemented as Web Services using SOAP messages as specified in BSI-TR-03129.

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>3 Protocols for Passive Authentication

Protocols and specifications for Terminal Authentication are used as specified in BSI-TR-03129. Beside SendMasterList and SendDefectList a TCC SHALL also implement SendDocumentSignerList and GetDocumentSignerList as described in the following sections.

#### 3.1 Distribution of Document Signer Lists

The following messages are used for the distribution of Document Signer Lists.

#### 3.1.1 GetDocumentSignerList

This message is sent by a terminal to its DV in order to get one or more signed lists of document signers.

| Parameter          | Property                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |  |

*Table 2: Input, Output and Return Codes parameters for message GetDocumentSignerList*

#### 3.1.2 SendDocumentSignerList

If the DV processes the message GetDefectList asynchronously, it uses the callback message SendDefectList to communicate the result of its processing. It sends the response message always to the URL specified in the parameter responseURL and the provided messageID of the received message.

This message can also be used to notify registered entities about the availability of a new Defect List. In this case the messageID MUST be omitted.

#### 3.3 Protocols for Terminal Authentication

Protocols and specifications for Terminal Authentication are used as specified in BSI-TR-03129.

### <span id="page-7-0"></span>4 Defect Lists for ePassport Application

This chapter defines Defect Lists for the handling of Defects in the context of official document checks making use of the ePassport Application on a chip. Defects relating to the eID Application are defined in BSI-TR-03129 and not part of this document.

A defect is defined as a production error affecting large numbers of documents. The withdrawal of already issued documents is impractical or even impossible if the detected defect is contained in foreign documents.

Defect Lists are errata that not only inform about defects but also provides corrigenda to fix the error where possible. Defect Lists are signed lists to handle such defects. Defects are identified by the Document Signer Certificate(s) used to produce defect documents. Defect Lists are provided as Signed Data according to RFC3852 [4] and SHALL be using the profile and list content description as specified in BSI-TR-03129.

### 4.1 Defect List Format

A terminal compliant with BSI-TR-03129-2 SHALL support version 1 and version 2 of the Defect List format. A Defect List SHALL be provided as BER encoded SignedData with content type DefectList identified by id-DefectList (see BSI-TR-03129):

```
bsi-de OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
 itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)
 reserved(127) etsi-identified-organization(0) 7
}
id-DefectList OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bsi-de applications(3) mrtd(1) 5 }
DefectList ::= SEQUENCE { 
               version INTEGER {v1(0), v2(1)}, 
               hashAlg OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
               defects SET OF Defect
```
}

Compared to version 1 of the Defect List Format, in version 2 of the Defect List Format a description field is added. It describes the class of a defect in human readable format and can contain additional information and notes on the defect or affected documents.

```
Defect ::= SEQUENCE { 
       signerIdentifier SignerIdentifier OPTIONAL, -- present in v1
       certificateHash OCTET STRING OPTIONAL, 
       knownDefects SET OF VersionedKnownDefect, 
       description UTF8String OPTIONAL -- only present in v2
```
}

Like in Defect there is also a description field in KnownDefect. It describes the known defect with additional technical details.

```
VersionedKnownDefect ::= CHOICE {
      knownDefect KnownDefect, -- use this if version is v1
```

```
knownDefectV2 [0] KnownDefectV2 -- use this if version is v2
}
KnownDefect ::= SEQUENCE { 
       defectType OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
       parameters ANY DEFINED BY defectType OPTIONAL
}
KnownDefectV2 ::= SEQUENCE { 
       defectType OBJECT IDENTIFIER, 
       parameters [0] ANY DEFINED BY defectType OPTIONAL,
       description [1] UTF8String OPTIONAL
}
```
The data type SignerIdentifier is defined in [4] as follows

```
SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE { 
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber, 
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier
}

#### 4.1.1 Identification of Document Signer Certificates

There are two options to reference the Document Signer Certificate in a Defect List, either by the distinguished name of the CSCA and the serial number of the Document Signer Certificate or by the Subject Key Identifier of the Document Signer Public Key. Those two options are augmented by a third option: If neither issuerAndSerialNumber nor the subjectKeyIdentifier uniquely identify the Document Signer (due to a defect in the certificate) the hash of the Document Signer Certificate MUST additionally be included. The hash function to be used is indicated in the Defect List.

#### 4.2 Defect Categories

Defects are categorized into three different types

- Authentication Defects
- Application Defects
- Document Defects

#### 4.2.1 Authentication Defects

This section describes defects related to Passive Authentication, Chip Authentication, and Active Authentication. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-AuthDefect OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DefectList 1}

#### 4.2.1.1 Document Signer Certificate Revoked

The private key of the Document Signer is compromised (e.g. revoked by a CRL).

Note that this defect is equivalent to an issued CRL containing the Document Signer. This type of defect can be used to revoke foreign Document Signers independently from a CRL.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides StatusCode as a parameter.

```
id-CertRevoked OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 1}
StatusCode ::= ENUMERATED { 
       noIndication(0), -- no details given 
       onHold(1), -- revocation under investigation 
       testing(2), -- the certificate has been used for testing 
       revokedByIssuer(3), -- the Issuer has revoked the certificate by CRL 
       revokedDLS(4), -- DS has revoked the certificate 
       certInadequate(5), -- The certificate is inadequate 
       proprietary(32) -- status codes >=32 for internal use
```

```
}
```
#### 4.2.1.2 Document Signer Certificate Malformed

The Document Signer Certificate is malformed and cannot be decoded correctly. Instead a replacement certificate is provided. Note that this certificate is not necessarily signed by the corresponding CSCA. Replacement Document Signer Certificates MAY be self-signed.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides a replacement certificate (Certificate, cf. [5]) as parameter.

id-CertReplaced OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 2}

#### 4.2.1.3 Chip Authentication Private Keys Compromised

The Chip Authentication Private Keys have been compromised (e.g. due to a error in the key generation algorithm). This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameters:

id-ChipAuthKeyRevoked OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 3}

#### 4.2.1.4 Active Authentication Private Keys Compromised

The Active Authentication Private Keys have been compromised (e.g. due to a error in the key generation algorithm). This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameters:

id-ActiveAuthKeyRevoked OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 4}

#### 4.2.1.5 Authentication Protocol Failure

AA or CA cannot be performed correctly. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier, without StatusCode as return parameter:

```
id-AuthenticationProtocolFailure OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 5}
StatusCode ::= ENUMERATED { 
       CA_failure(0), -- CA is known to fail
       AA_failure(1), -- AA is known to fail
       CA_AA_failure(2) -- CA and AA are known to fail
       PACE_CAM_failure(3) -- PACE-CAM known to fail
```
}

#### 4.2.1.6 Validity Period Incorrect

The validity period of the DS or CSCA is incorrect, i. e. the certificate-chain did not follow the PKIX shell model. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides StatusCode as a parameter.

```
id-ValidityPeriodIncorrect OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-AuthDefect 6}
StatusCode ::= ENUMERATED { 
       CSCA_validity(0), -- CSCA cert. validity is incorrect 
       DS_validity(1) -- DS cert. validity is incorrect
       CSCA_DS_validity(2), -- Validity of both certs incorrect
}
```
### 4.2.2 Application Defects (for the ePassport Application)

The following sections describe defects related to the personalisation of the ePassport application. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-ePassportDefect OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DefectList 2}

#### 4.2.2.1 Data Group Malformed

The indicated data groups might be incorrectly encoded. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides the malformed datagroups with the parameter MalformedDGs:

id-ePassportDGMalformed OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ePassportDefect 1}

MalformedDGs ::= SET OF INTEGER -- DGs as integer

#### 4.2.2.2 Document Security Object Malformed

The validation of the Document Security Object might fail (e.g. signature incorrect). This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides SODFaultStatusCode as an optional parameter.

```
id-SODInvalid OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ePassportDefect 2}
SodFaultStatusCode ::= ENUMERATED { 
       noIndication(0), -- no details given 
       sodSignatureFailure(1), -- Failure in SOD's signature
```

```
sodHashInvalid(2), -- sodHashInvalid 
sodEncodingFailure(3), -- wrong encoding / encoding error 
sodDGHashesInvalid(4), -- wrong/invalid DG hashes (or encoding)
proprietary(32) -- >=32 codes used for internal purposes
```

```
}
```
#### 4.2.2.3 COM and SOD Discrepancy

The list of present datagroups contained in EF.COM and/or EF.SOD are not correct. The Defect also provides dataGroupDiscrepancy as an optional parameter. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier.

```
id-COMSODDiscrepancy OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ePassportDefect 3}
DataGroupDiscrepancy ::= SEQUENCE { 
       listedInCOM SET OF INTEGER, -- data groups as defined through COM 
       listedInSOD SET OF INTEGER -- data groups as defined through SOD
}
```
The parameter dataGroupDiscrepancy defines which datagroups are present by its definition through EF.COM or EF.SOD, thus it is possible to trace and analyze the discrepancy defect in more detail. If the optional parameter is not present, the discrepancy is interpreted as a generic.

#### 4.2.2.4 Wrong Signer Identifier

The signer identifier in EF.SOD is wrong, hence no document signer certificate can be found in the security object. The signer identifier structure is used to request the corresponding DS certificate. If there exists a known defect for this identifier the TCC responds with a document signer certificate (Certificate, cf. [5]) as parameter.

id-sodWrongSignerIdentifier OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ePassportDefect 4}

#### 4.2.2.5 Issuing Country Defect

The referenced issuing Country in the certificate was wrong, e.g. ICAO 3-letter code instead of ICAO 2-letter code [2], or a missing country, or the issuer used a wrong issuing country. The Defect provides correctedIssuingCountry as an returned parameter.

```
id-IssuingCountryDefect OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ePassportDefect 5}
```
correctedIssuingCountry :: = PrintableString

#### 4.2.3 General Document Defects

The following sections describe defects related to the document in general. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-DocumentDefect OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DefectList 4}

If a document is affected by a general defect (i.e. the defect is contained the sub-tree of id-DocumentDefect) with unknown interpretation, the electronic part of the document SHOULD NOT be used.

#### 4.2.3.1 Card Security Object Malformed

The Card Security Object is incorrectly encoded. A corrected Card Security Object is provided and SHOULD be used. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides a corrected Card Security Object (SecurityObject, cf. [3]) as parameter:

id-CardSecurityMalformed OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DocumentDefect 1}

#### 4.2.3.2 Chip Security Object Malformed

The Chip Security Object might be incorrectly encoded. The Card Security Object SHOULD be used instead. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameter:

id-ChipSecurityMalformed OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DocumentDefect 2}

#### 4.2.3.3 Powerdown Required

The chip denies multiple successive authentication using the General Authentication Procedure. Either the reader MUST powerdown the chip or the document MUST be removed from the reader in between two authentications. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameter:

id-PowerDownReq OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DocumentDefect 3}

#### 4.2.3.4 Document Signer Certificate incorrectly encoded or malformed

The Document Signer Certificate is incorrectly encoded or malformed and could not be used. Compared to the Defect id-CertReplaced there is no replacement certificate provided. Hence additional information about this Defect is provided with DSMalformedInformation as a parameter. This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier and a parameter:

```
id-DSMalformed OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-DocumentDefect 4}
DsMalformedInformation ::= ENUMERATED { 
       noIndication(0), -- no details given 
       unknownCryptoAlg(1), -- unknown cryptographic algorithm 
       encodingFailure(2), -- wrong encoding / encoding error 
       proprietary(32) -- codes >=32 can be used for internal purposes
}
```
### <span id="page-13-0"></span>5 Signed Data Profile for Document Signer Lists

Document Signer Lists are provided as Signed Data according to RFC3852 [4] and SHALL be using the profile as defined in BSI-TR-03129, Appendix C. The value eContentType shall be id-DocumentSignerList.

#### 5.1 Document Signer List Format

A Document Signer List must be provided as BER encoded SignedData with content type identified by id-DocumentSignerList. The list of Document Signer certificates is a set of x.509 certificates in BER encoding.

```
bsi-de OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
 itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)
 reserved(127) etsi-identified-organization(0) 7
}
```
id-DocumentSignerList OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bsi-de applications(3) mrtd(1) 6 }
