# <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 Introduction

This technical guideline specifies two complimentary web services that provide validation of Machine-Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs) according to the TR-03135-1. They comprise the document check process as well as the required logging of the results.

# 1.1 Motivation

The checking of MRTDs according to TR-03135-1 requires a large number of individual steps. Some steps require a certain order of execution or may only be relevant for particular documents. In contrast to a fixed definition of scenario-specific check processes, the processing and visualization of results and/or document data may vary with the purpose of the Inspection Application. The complexity of the document check process causes large efforts for the creation and quality control of Inspection Applications.

The goal of this document is to provide high-level interfaces that reduces the programming effort for Inspection Applications by separating the document check process and standard-compliant logging from the problem-specific processing and visualization of results.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>2 Architecture for Inspection Applications

# 2.1 Client-Server Architecture

To ease the implementation of Inspection Applications for document checks, they are split into two parts. Frontends, or *clients,* are application-specific. They provide a user interface and process and visualize results depending on their particular purpose. The TR-03135-1-compliant document check process and the corresponding transaction logging are provided by a backend *server* as web services. This separation reduces the effort to implement Inspection Applications for different purposes considerably.

# 2.2 Workflow-Based Document Check

To further reduce the effort for client implementation, the document check process is configured based on a textual description in XML rather than program code. A particular configuration is referred to as *workflow*, its description as *workflow definition*. This definition allows the customization of the application-scenariospecific document check process within the limits of TR-03135-1.

It controls which optical, electronic and combined checks are carried out and which data are required for processing. The document data and check results are referred to as *feedback*. Please refer to Section [5.5](#page-31-0) for an exhaustive specification of the workflow definition and Section [5.6](#page-63-0) for the specification of the feedback data format.

The workflow definition can be provided by the client or the server. This allows clients to use custom workflows but also allows centralized management on the server. All workflows are managed by the server and are available to all clients. Workflows are executed on the server upon request by the client. Relevant feedback is generated on the server and can be fetched by the client individually.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>*Figure 1: Client-side document check process*

Initiate workflow execution

Fetch one feedback

[Figure 1](#page-7-1) visualizes the client side of the document check process. Workflow-related interface operations are highlighted in orange. After a new document is detected, the client requests execution of the relevant workflow. In the following, the client individually fetches the feedback elements that are defined in the workflow from the server and processes them appropriately, e.g. by visualizing them to the user. After all feedback has been processed successfully, the client informs the server that client-side processing has finished. Section [4.1](#page-12-1) provides a quick overview of the interface functions. The interface specification can be found in Chapter [5.](#page-15-0) MRTD detected Document check finished End transaction Begin a new transaction

TR-03135-1 requires logging of all relevant check results which is provided by the interface specified in Chapter [6.](#page-83-0) If multiple documents need to be checked, the corresponding transactions can be merged into a single transaction for consistent logging of related document checks. yes

<span id="page-8-0"></span>*Figure 2: Extension of Figure 1 with TR-03135-1-compliant logging*

[Figure 2](#page-8-0) shows the extension of the client side of the document check process from [Figure 1](#page-7-1) with transaction logging operations (highlighted in blue, dashed). The client initiates a new transaction after a MRTD was detected and before initiating workflow execution. After the workflow execution and result processing is finished, the client requests saving of the corresponding transaction log and then ends the transaction. Section [4.2](#page-13-0) provides a quick overview of the interface functions.

# 2.4 Cross-document combined check

Part 1 of this Technical Guideline specifies checks across two different documents (e.g. passport and visa) or two sides of the same document (e.a. front and rear side of ID cards).

Initially, both documents (or document sides) are checked individually. Cross-document combined checks, which are always defined for a specific document (e.g. visa), are skipped.

Its the responsibility of the client to control which documents are considered for cross-document combined checks. After linking the respective documents, the cross-document combined checks are executed.

The Inspection Application MUST merge the corresponding transaction to ensure consistent logging of the checking process.

Figure [3](#page-9-0) shows the extension of the single document checking process in Figure [2](#page-8-0) which accounts for potential cross-document combined checks. After finishing the initial checking of a document, the client checks if feedback elements for any cross-document combined checks are missing. If so, the client needs to link the currently checked document (e.g. visa) to the relevant reference document (e.g. passport) and rerequest the corresponding feedback elements. Afterwards, the corresponding transactions for both documents must be merged.

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>3 Document overview

# 3.1 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# 3.2 Naming conventions

# 3.2.1 Multiplicity

Generally, XML elements and attributes listed in this document are required, i.e. the respective parent element MUST contain exactly one such element. Elements and attributes that deviate from this baseline are denoted in this document by a symbol which is appended to the element/attribute name. The symbols are listed in [1.](#page-10-2)

<span id="page-10-2"></span>

|  | Table 1: Multiplicity symbols |  |
|--|-------------------------------|--|
|--|-------------------------------|--|

| Appended symbol | Meaning      |
|-----------------|--------------|
| ?               | Zero or one  |
| *               | Zero or more |
| +               | One or more  |

#### 3.2.2 SOAP Interfaces

All operations of this interface follow the request/response model, i.e., communication is initiated by the client by sending a SOAP message to the server (request). For each request, the server replies with a SOAP message containing the result of the requested operation (response) or, in case of error, a fault.

The body of each SOAP message consists of a single part which is named according to the corresponding operation. For requests, the part name is identical to the name of the operation. For responses, the part name is identical to the name of the operation plus the suffix "Response" (see Table [2\)](#page-10-1).

<span id="page-10-1"></span>*Table 2: Naming convention for SOAP messages*

| Message type | Part name                |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Request      | <operation_name>         |
| Response     | <operation_name>Response |

#### *Example: Naming convention*

- Operation: getAllWorkflows
- Request: getAllWorkflows
- Response: getAllWorkflowsResponse

Both request and response elements exclusively contain zero or more child elements according to the detailed description in this guideline. They do not carry any attributes.

# 3.5 Interoperability

To ensure trouble-free interoperability between different SOAP implementations, both client and server implmenentations SHOULD fulfill the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.

# <span id="page-12-0"></span>4 Interface overview

# <span id="page-12-1"></span>4.1 High-Level Document Check

# 4.1.1 Objective

The High-level Document Check (HLDC) interface provides execution of TR-03135-compliant document checks controlled by XML-based workflow definitions.

# 4.1.2 Document detection

The client MAY choose to be notified of a newly detected document by explicit waiting (blocking).

• Calling waitForNewDocument blocks client execution until a new document is detected (limited by a timeout).

# 4.1.3 Workflow management

- The client MAY publish custom workflow definitions on the server by calling addWorkflow. Identically named workflow definitions are replaced.
- The client MAY remove workflow definitions from the server by calling removeWorkflow.
- The function getAllWorkflows provides a list of all workflow definitions that are available on the server.

# 4.1.4 Workflow execution

- The function beginWorkflow executes a document check workflow. If no transaction ID is provided, the server MUST initiate a new transaction internally to ensure TR-03135-compliant logging. beginWorkflow provides a unique workflow ID that MUST be used in subsequent calls. In general, the ID MUST remain valid until the client calls endWorkflow. To protect against broken clients, the server MAY limit the ID validity with a timeout.
- Workflow execution MAY be cancelled by calling cancelWorkflow.
- The client MUST inform the server that client-side workflow processing has finished by calling endWorkflow.

# 4.1.5 Workflow feedback

Document and check result data are provided by the server individually and are referred to as workflow feedback.

- The function getWorkflowFeedback provides the next available feedback element.
- The client MAY request particular document and result data by calling getWorkflowFeedbackById.

# 4.1.6 Cross-document checks

If a workflow contains definitions for cross-document combined checks, the client SHOULD call linkWorkflow in order to assign the relevant reference document. The call MUST appear after feedback processing for the current document has finished.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>4.2 Transaction management interface

# 4.2.1 Objective

The transaction management interface provides functions to link document check operations to a TR-03135-compliant transaction and to allow logging of relevant data.

# 4.2.2 Transaction management

- Transactions are initiated by beginTransaction. In contrast to calling the HLDC function beginWorkflow without a transaction ID, this function provides an ID that is REQUIRED for all the functions of this interface and MAY be used when calling beginWorkflow in order to link the workflow execution to this particular transaction.
- Multiple transactions MAY be merged into a single one with mergeTransaction.
- Transactions are terminated by endTransaction which invalidates the transaction ID.

# 4.2.3 Logging

- The function saveTransaction stores the currently available logged transaction data persistently on the server. The client MAY limit the amount of data that is stored.
- The client MAY request the currently available transaction data for client-side use by calling getTransactionXML.
- Client-specific data MAY be logged by calling addLogData.
- The function getAllLoggingProviders is OPTIONAL and MAY return a server-specific list of logging targets that MAY be used when calling saveTransaction.
- The function saveTransactionXML allows to store client-generated XML via available logging providers.
- The client MAY publish custom logging profiles (XSLT) on the server by calling addLoggingProfile. Identically named logging profiles are replaced.
- The client MAY remove logging profiles from the server by calling removeLoggingProfile

# 4.2.4 Write-protection

In order to prevent inconsistent log data, a transaction is protected against further modification after the first read access, i.e., after calls to saveTransaction and getTransactionXML. All future write access, i.e., calls that would modify the transaction, MUST fail then with an appropriate error.

The server MAY fail read access calls with appropriate error if the transaction is currently modified (e.g., by the document check process).

# 4.3 Error handling

If errors occur during processing of a web service request, a SOAP fault is generated according to the SOAP 1.1 specification. SOAP faults are comparable to exceptions in programming languages such as C++, C# or Java insofar as they allow reporting of errors without the need to account for error codes in function signatures.

SOAP faults are returned in place of the SOAP response. Depending on the type of an error, the fault message may contain additional information about the error. The faults that are specific to the web services in this document are specified in the respective chapters and listed with every function that may generate them. Faults originating from other causes such as network connection problems or validation errors are beyond the scope of this document as they depend on the specific SOAP implementation.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>5 High Level Document Check API

The High Level Document Check API (short: HLDC API) contains functions to perform electronic and optical document checks in conformity to part 1 of this Technical Guideline. The check processes are driven by XML workflows and provide a very high level interface to the application. The check results contain multiple sub-results which are combined to overall results according to TR-03135 Part 1. All checks can be logged in XML format compliant to TR-03135 Part 1 using the transaction management API in Chapter [6.](#page-83-0)

The definitions of the HLDC API are provided in hldc\_v2.wsdl. The schemata for the workflow definition and XML-formatted feedback are provided in wf\_v2.xsd and fb\_v2.xsd respectively.

# 5.1 Namespaces

The elements of the server- and client-side APIs are member of the namespace <http://trdoccheck.bsi.bund.de/hldc/wsdl/2>, which is aliased by hldc. The workflow definition schema and the workflow feedback schema use the namespace <http://trdoccheck.bsi.bund.de/hldc/workflow/2> aliased by wf.

# 5.2 Data types

In addition to simple XSD types, the SOAP interface uses custom data types, which are described in the following.

# 5.2.1 FeedbackStatus

Combined checks that require information from a different document check will fetch this information from workflow referredWorkflowID. If the workflow status of the workflow checkWorkflowID is cancelled, calling linkWorkflow has no effect. If checkWorkflowID and referredWorkflowID are part of different check transactions, it is RECOMMENDED to call tl:mergeTransaction (see Section [6.4.7\)](#page-92-0) for these transactions.

# 5.7 Workflow extensions

The workflow and feedback specification of the high-level document check allow for implementationspecific extensions. This section specifies the constraints for such extensions.

# 5.7.1 Workflow definition

- 1. All server implementations MUST correctly validate all workflow definitions that conform to this document.
- 2. All implementation-specific extensions MUST be placed below the hldc-wf:Extension node. To prevent conflicts between multiple extension implementations, only one extension is allowed per workflow.
- 3. A server MUST validate known extensions. Any errors MAY be reported with a regular validation error message as part of the WorkflowParserError.
- 4. A server MUST reject unknown extensions to prevent incomplete or incorrect interpretation of the workflow definition. The WorkflowParserError MUST explicitly state that the extension was rejected.
- 5. Extension elements MAY refer to IDs in the regular workflow definition and vice versa. This allows extensions that are transparent to the client (e.g. by adding a new type of condition).

# 5.7.2 Feedback

- 1. If the workflow extension does not define custom feedback elements, the workflow and its feedback MUST be processable by all clients that conform to this document without modification of the client.
- 2. All XML-based feedback MUST be validatable by all conformant clients.
- 3. All feedback requests that conform to this Technical Guideline MUST be answered by corresponding conformant feedback. Custom feedback MAY only be used for implementation-specific feedback requests.
- 4. Extensions MAY provide feedback as
	- modifications of regular feedback
	- text-based feedback in the stringFeedback field of WorkflowFeedback
	- binary feedback in the binaryFeedback field of WorkflowFeedback
	- Custom XML-based feedback using the wf:ExtensionFeedback node

# <span id="page-83-0"></span>6 Transaction management

#### 6.4.9 saveTransaction

Saves the current transaction state as TR-03135-compliant XML data the via a logging provider. If called, MUST be called between beginTransaction and endTransaction.

In order to save log data from an HLDC workflow, it is RECOMMENDED to call saveTransaction only after workflow execution has stopped to ensure that the log data is complete with respect to the workflow.

Workflow execution has stopped if either of the following is true:

- getWorkflowFeedback or getWorkflowFeedbackById return workflowStatus finished or cancelled
- cancelWorkflow was called
- endWorkflow was called.

Otherwise, the server MAY fail the call with InProgress fault.

On success, the transaction MUST be flagged as read-only to prevent further modification.

The server MAY log the data asynchronously and return the call of saveTransaction before the actual logging has finished.
