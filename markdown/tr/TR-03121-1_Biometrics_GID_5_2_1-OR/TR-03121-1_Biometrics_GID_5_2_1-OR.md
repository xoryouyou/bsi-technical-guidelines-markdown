### <span id="page-15-0"></span>2 Introduction

### <span id="page-15-1"></span>2.1 Motivation and Objectives of Technical Guideline Biometrics

Biometric methods are used in many different areas of applications. The solutions and systems available on the market are able to serve a broad range regarding performance, security, usability and standard confor mance. For public sector applications, it is necessary to define precise requirements and general conditions. Furthermore, the systems have to be defined in a way which allows for extension in future developments.

The objective of this Technical Guideline (TR Biometrics) is to offer a basis for a consistent and comparable quality of public sector applications and for building a common architecture.

This guideline has the following objectives:

- **â¢** *Modularity:* The complete guideline is built from several single guideline modules. For a single application area only the respective modules have to be taken into account. This is done in order to avoid side effects between different kinds of applications which would occur due to changes of special functions.
- **â¢** *Clarity:* The concept of this guideline follows a well structured framework. With this framework it is easily understandable which kind of guideline modules are valid for the respective application scenario.
- **â¢** *Expandability:* Modularity is the key component of expandability in the scope of this guideline. This is valid regarding new applications as well as new functional units.
- **â¢** *Standard conformance:* The Technical Guideline takes national and international standards and guidelines into account and deploys them for governmental applications.
- **â¢** *Conformance and certification:* The guideline modules are designed in such a way that requirements and conditions for single functional units are clearly separated from each other. Products for single functional units are clearly defined regarding the interfaces and the range of their functionality so that they can be tested for conformance with this guideline and certified.
- **â¢** *Ability to reference:* The use of functional units allows to specify precise requirements for products that are used in according application scenarios. Therefore, this guideline can be used as a reference e.g. for tenders.
- **â¢** *Market orientation:* The definition of functional units is related to the products that can be found on the market. Requirements of the guideline can be unambiguously assigned to respective systems and com ponents.

It should be noted that the content of this guideline is limited to aspects biometric characteristics. In terfaces to further technologies (e.g. connection of optical or electronic document readers) are out of scope of this document.

#### <span id="page-15-2"></span>2.2 Target Audience and User

Audience for this guideline are institutions that are dealing with projects using biometric characteristics in public sector applications. These include:

- **â¢** Agencies that are issuing identity documents or visas, e.g. passport agencies of the local authorities mis sions abroad of the Federal Foreign Office.
- **â¢** Public Authorities using biometric applications for identity verification of people, e.g. the German Federal Police (Polizeien des Bundes) or the Police of the Federal States (Polizeien der LÃ¤nder), the German Customs Administration (Bundeszollverwaltung) or the Federal Administrative Office (Bundesverwaltungsamt).

Beside these users, this guideline also addresses vendors of biometric systems as well integrators and app lication developers.

#### <span id="page-15-3"></span>2.3 Terminology

The key words "MUST", MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this Technical Guideline are to be interpreted as described in [\[BIB\\_RFC2119\]](#page-26-1).

#### <span id="page-16-0"></span>2.4 Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN)

<span id="page-16-1"></span>The processes in this Technical Guideline are modelled using the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). [Figure 2.1](#page-16-1) gives an overview over the relevant icons herein.

**Figure 2.1.** BPMN Symbols used for the Process Modelling

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>3 Structure of Technical Guideline Biometrics

This Technical Guideline consists of the following parts:

**â¢** Part 1: Framework (TR-03121-1)

TR-03121-1 is the framework document of the guideline. It explains the concept and the relation between the different parts.

**â¢** Part 2: Software Architecture (TR-03121-2)

The [High Level Biometric Services \(HLBS\)](#page-25-4) as well as Service Definitions for specific use cases are specified here.

- **â¢** Part 3: Application Profiles, Function Modules and Processes (TR-03121-3)
	- **â¢** In the third part, the different Application Profiles with corresponding Partial Application Processes and Function Modules are defined. These contain the detailed technical requirements for each of com ponents.
		- **â¢** Application Profiles may reference Function Modules, Partial Processes and Service De finitions (refer to Part 2).
		- **â¢** Partial Application Processes may refer to Function Module Categories and may be comprised of *Tasks*. Tasks are processes which are part of more than one Partial Application Process.
	- **â¢** For practical purposes, this part is split up in different volumes to serve different user groups.

Please refer to [Figure 3.1](#page-18-0) for a class diagram of the structure described above.

<span id="page-18-0"></span>![](_page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 3.1.** Class Diagram of the Technical Guidelines

Additionally, the Technical Guideline BSI-TR 03122 "Conformance Test Specification for Technical Guideline TR-03121 Biometrics for Public Sector Applications" describes the requirements that are essential to declare conformance or to declare the absence of conformance. It consists of the following parts:

- **â¢** Part 1: Framework (TR-03122-1)
- **â¢** Part 3: Test Cases for Function Modules and Processes (TR-03122-3)
- **â¢** Part 4: Additional Test Cases (TR-03122-4)

### <span id="page-19-0"></span>4 How to use this Technical Guideline

This chapter gives a short overview how to read and apply this guideline step by step.

- 1. The user chooses the desired Application Profile. With the help of the Application Profile the user can get a deeper insight into the application, the required software architecture components and the described functionality. TR-03121-2 offers further information about the software architecture component model.
- 2. Based on the Application Profile, the mandatory Partial Application Processes and Function Modules are identified. One profile can link to several Partial Application Processes and Function Modules due dif ferent kinds of underlying biometric characteristics or the fact that different technologies (e.g. scanners or digital cameras for the digitisation of a photo) are used.

Function Modules are referenced by an explicit identifier, e.g. AH-FP-GID. The first part identifies the requirement type (e.g. Hardware), the second part represents the biometric characteristic (e.g. fingerprint), and the last part denotes a further descriptor, typically the scope (e.g. German Identity Document).

Function Modules for different biometric characteristics are divided by a comma while a choice between different technologies is denoted by a slash (e.g. AH-FP-FTR, AH-PH-FBS/AH-PH-DC).

If a Function Module is denoted with a placeholder between a less-than and greater-than sign (< >) the actual referenced Function Module is dependant on the context in which the Function Module has been mentioned. For example the Function Module AH-FI-<VL> has been mentioned within a Partial Applica tion Process used in the Border Control (BCL) volume, then the actual referenced Function Module is AH-FI-BCL. The same procedure holds for Application Profiles denoted as <AP> analogously. If no specific Function Module applies, then there are no further requirements defined for this context.

Partial Application Processes are referenced by an explicit identifier, refer to Partial Application Profile section.

3. On the basis of identifier according Function Module and Partial Application Processes can be ex amined. Every Function Module and Partial Application Process provides detailed technical requirements and recommendations. Note, each reference to an Function Module or Partial Application Processes is a link within the document.

### <span id="page-21-0"></span>6 Application Profiles

Different areas in which this guideline can be used are defined in separate Application Profiles. Application Profiles can have mandatory status, e.g. through published regulations and laws or by requirements given in tenders. Besides, such Application Profiles can also be considered as Best Practices.

An Application Profile is described with the following items:

- **â¢** Introduction (legal requirements)
- **â¢** Process overview
	- **â¢** Target audience
	- **â¢** Users
- **â¢** Relevant standards and conditions
- **â¢** List of
	- **â¢** mandatory Function Modules
	- **â¢** mandatory Partial Application Processes

### <span id="page-22-0"></span>7 Function Modules

#### <span id="page-22-1"></span>7.1 Organisation of the Function Modules

Specific technical requirements are structured in Function Modules. They contain detailed require ments for the respective component.

Function Modules are aligned to the products on the market and to the targets of evaluation.

Every Function Module is built of one or more sub-clauses which are assigned to unique identifiers. Within the sub-clauses requirements and recommendations are specified in detail.

Partial Application Processes are referenced by their ID, which can contain up to three information items pointing to its contents.

The basic structure of an ID is: "FM AAA-BBB-CCC", where "AAA" is the so-called primary information item (see: [Table 7.1\)](#page-22-3).

#### <span id="page-22-2"></span>7.2 Function Module Classes

[Table 7.1](#page-22-3) gives an overview of the different Function Module categories.

### <span id="page-24-0"></span>8 Partial Application Processes

#### <span id="page-24-1"></span>8.1 Organisation of the Partial Application Processes

Partial Application Processes are referenced by their ID, which can contain up to three information items pointing to its contents.

The basic structure of an ID is: "PAP (Task) AAA-BBB-CCC-#".

Here, "Task" is optional and is only used if the PAP is a task. *AAA* is the primary information item, pointing to the main contents. *BBB* and *CCC* are optional information items, which can further specify the [PAP](#page-25-2). These information items may be 1-6 alphanumeric digits. The abbreviations used for the [PAP](#page-25-2) ID are listed in [Ta](#page-24-2) [ble 8.1](#page-24-2) and [Table 8.2.](#page-24-3) All [PAP](#page-25-2) IDs end with a number *#*. This number is usually 1, unless multiple IDs with similar preceding information items exist. In this case, they are enumerated increasingly.
