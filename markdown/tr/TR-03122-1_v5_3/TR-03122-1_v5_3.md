**Table 1.6** Changelog BSI TR-03122, Part 3

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**2. Introduction**

This document is part one of the Conformance Test Specification (BSI TR-03122). It is the counterpart of BSI TR-03121-1 describing the framework of the conformance test documents for BSI TR-03121.

### <span id="page-8-1"></span>**2.1. Motivation and Objectives of the Conformance Test Specification**

The Technical Guideline Biometrics for Public Sector Applications (BSI TR-03121) specifies requirements and recommendations for the use of biometric data within the scope public sector applications. The requirements on specific Function Modules, as defined in BSI TR-03121-3, can be implemented for different public sector applications through hardware and software components from various vendors.

The objective of this Technical Guideline is to offer a base for consistent and comparable quality assessment regarding the different components that will be applied in order to fulfil these requirements. This confor mance test specification

- **•** specifies tests for the Software Architecture (in particular in regard to conformance testing),
- **•** defines all test cases being relevant to verify the conformance for the different requirements described in the Function Modules.

### <span id="page-8-2"></span>**2.2. Target Audience**

Audience for this guideline are institutions that are dealing with projects using biometrics in public sector applications that require certified modules, hardware, and/or software. These include:

- **•** Vendors of hardware or software products that want to present their solutions for conformance test and acquire to be compliant to this Technical Guideline.
- **•** Evaluation laboratories that check the conformance of hardware and/or software modules that are used within the scope of biometrics and electronic identity documents in public sector applications.

### <span id="page-8-3"></span>**2.3. Structure of the Conformance Test Specification**

The Conformance Test Specification consists of the following parts:

**•** Part 1: Framework (BSI TR-03122-1)

TR-03122-1 is the framework document of the conformance test specification.

**•** Part 3: Test Cases for Function Modules and Processes (BSI TR-03122-3)

The third part defines test cases for hardware and software components as well as processes according to their specification in TR-03121-3.

### <span id="page-8-4"></span>**2.4. Test Case Specification for Function Modules**

1. The requirements for an electronic identity document and the connected public sector application are combined in several Function Modules within BSI TR-03121-3. If the conformance to one or more specific Function Modules has to be checked, the reader has to identify at first the relevant Function Modules with the according abbreviation e.g. LOG-FP-GID.

- 2. As a result the corresponding test cases can be selected in BSI TR-03122-3 under the same identification while the prefix 'TC-' indicates the according test case. Depending on the number of defined test cases the abbreviation is followed by an ascending numbering e.g. TC#LOG#FP-GID-001.
- 3. In general, a test case in BSI TR-03122-3 is structured in three parts as shown in [Table 2.1](#page-9-1).

**Table 2.1** Example of the Structure of a Test Case

Conformance to the specification of a Function Module can be established if all test cases for that Function Module are completed successfully and the requirements of the test methodology are satisfied.

Several test cases can be assigned to one Function Module each containing one or multiple test steps.

Note, that the Conformance Test Specification does not define requirements for the object to be tested except the interfaces for conformance testing.

### <span id="page-9-0"></span>**2.5. Conformance Test Interfaces**

Conformance testing in the context of BSI TR-03121 is based on an interface compliant to [Representational](#page-12-1) [State Transfer \(REST\).](#page-12-1) This interface is described in the following sections.

The [Implementation Under Test \(IUT\)](#page-12-2) must provide an external interface as [REST](#page-12-1) service accessible to the [Conformance Test Suite \(CTS\),](#page-12-3) through which conformance testing is performed. Using this interface, the [IUT](#page-12-2) is able to output generated data to the [CTS](#page-12-3) during the test execution of the regular process which is performed by the operator of the evaluation laboratory.

Additionally, the interface can be used to provide pre-defined input from the [CTS](#page-12-3) to the [IUT](#page-12-2) in order to be able to verify its output in a defined state.

In opposite to the standard workflow, this request is used as an alternative point of entry so that the standard steps for the acquisition of the biometric image (e.g. facial image or fingerprint image), further processing of the image and/or compression of the image can be skipped.

In case pre-defined input data is required for a test case, the [IUT](#page-12-2) is provided with external test data through the interface by the [CTS](#page-12-3). The input data is provided as XML data with root element "biocts-testsetup" as defined in the XML schemata of BSI TR-03121. The schema definition can be found in the file "biocts4v7.xsd". An example can be found in the file "biocts-testsetup.xml".

### **2.5.1. Interface description**

In the conformance test scenario, a client-server architecture is at hand. The [IUT represents the server provi](#page-12-2) ding a HTTP-based [REST](#page-12-1)-interface to the [CTS](#page-12-3) which acts as the client.

A test case is triggered by an HTTP request sent by the [CTS](#page-12-3) to the [IUT](#page-12-2) . The path as part of the reques[tUniform](#page-12-4) [Recourse Identifier \(URI\)s](#page-12-4)pecifies the test case ID as defined in part 3 of this guideline:

/TR03122/{testcase-id}/{version}

The version indicates the revision of the specification for this test case and is typically incremented when the test case's interface requirements are changed.

The HTTP request method (relevant are GET and POST) depends on whether the test case requires input data. As described above, any input data for the [IUT](#page-12-2) must be embedded in XML data (biocts-testsetup) within the request.

The result generated by the [IUT](#page-12-2) must also be returned as XML data to the [CTS](#page-12-3). Depending on the test case at hand, the result consists of XML data conforming to BSI TR-03121, which further may include an embedded, application specific format (e.g. [German Standard for AFIS Transactions Version 3 \(GSAT3\)](#page-12-5) XML). The specific data format and[URI](#page-12-4)for test case initiation is described further in each test case definition of BSI TR-03122 Part 3.

Since performing a test case may comprise manual interaction within the [IUT](#page-12-2) and hence can take accordingly long, the communication timeout has to be considered and set adequately high.

### **2.5.1.1. Test Cases Not Requiring Pre-Defined Input Data**

In case a test case does not require any input data a priori, the [CTS](#page-12-3) sends a GET request to the [IUT](#page-12-2) . The [IUT](#page-12-2) is triggered upon receiving the request and performs the test case (e.g. facial image capture and encoding).

Subsequently, the result data is returned to the [CTS](#page-12-3) within the response body. The response header must be set to "Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8" and include the message length of the response body.

```
Example:
Request (CTS → IUT ):
GET /TR03122/TC-COD-PH-GSAT3-001/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Response (IUT → CTS):
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 12345
<are:aad-app [...]
<bio:Records>
<bio:XMLRecord type="gsat-xml" purpose="enrolment" id="id_1234" size="5687">
[...]
```
</are:aad-app>

#### **2.5.1.2. Test Cases Requiring Pre-Defined Input Data**

Should a test case require initial provision of data, the [CTS](#page-12-3) sends a POST request to the [IUT](#page-12-2) including this data. The request header must be set to "Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8" and include the content length. Any input data is provided within the message body as XML (UTF-8 encoded).

The result data is returned to the [CTS](#page-12-3) within the response body including a response header set to "Content-Ty pe: application/xml; charset=utf-8" and respective content length.

```
Example:
Request (CTS → IUT ):
POST /TR03122/TC-QA-PH-SB-001/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 12345
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```
[...]

<biocts:Parameter type="face" format="bmp">

VghpcyBmaWVQLg==</biocts:Parameter>

</biocts:biocts-testsetup>

Response ([IUT](#page-12-2) → [CTS](#page-12-3)):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8

Content-Length: 67890

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
