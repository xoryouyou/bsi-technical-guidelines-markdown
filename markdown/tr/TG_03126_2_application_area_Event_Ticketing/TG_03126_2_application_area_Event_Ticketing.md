# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**1 Description of the "eTicketing for events" application area**

Entrance to sporting events, concerts, trade fairs, theatres and so on usually requires that the entrant has an entitlement specially purchased from the event organiser, otherwise known as a ticket. Traditionally this entitlement comes in the form of a visible token (ticket, strip, badge, stamp, etc.) which is checked visually and perhaps validated (torn off) by marshals upon entry. If other information about the event is to be conveyed, such as block, row or seat number, then paper tickets are usually issued with that information printed on them.

Experience has shown that it is impossible to monitor people's access reliably if the entitlements are checked only visually. For example, inspection staff cannot always notice falsified entitlements. That is why electronic access systems are becoming more and more common. They restrict access by means of controlled barriers (turnstiles and so on), check the entitlement automatically, and only grant access if the entitlement is valid. Using this kind of electronic access equipment requires entitlements that can be read by machines. In the past these were often loaded onto magnetic strips, and today it is usually a barcode ticket that is used for individual entry. But if larger amounts of money are involved (such as a season ticket for league football matches), or if special reliability and protection against falsification are required, then chip cards with contact-less proximity interfaces are an increasingly popular solution.

Electronic access systems were introduced at the twelve World Cup stadiums for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. This access technology, which supports the contact-less proximity interface defined in ISO/IEC14443, was not just used during the World Cup. Since then many of the stadium operators and resident clubs have introduced compatible carrier media and eTicketing systems that utilise the newly installed access technology for their league fixtures.

Contact-less chip technology is not yet widespread for one-off events such as concerts, even in cases where the access technology exists at the venue. Normally, tickets are still checked visually, or barcode tickets are used.

# <span id="page-12-1"></span><span id="page-12-0"></span>**2 Description of services, products and carrier media**

In Germany, the "eTicketing for events" application area can be divided into three areas:

- 1 Sporting events; the World Cup stadiums already have the necessary electronic access technology.
- 2 One-off events for which tickets are sold by online ticket retailers and advance sales offices.
- 3 Trade fairs, such as CeBit and railtec.

Customers are granted access to the events, for which the following products are offered using eTicketing:

- 1 One-off entitlement -> Single entry to events such as concerts, trade fairs or stadium events.
- 2 Multiple entitlement -> Multiple entry. Equivalent to several one-off entitlements e.g. a season ticket for the national football league or a multiple-entry pass to CeBit.
- 3 Season entitlement -> An unlimited number of entries within the period of validity.
- 4 Additional entitlement -> An upgrade by which additional one-off entitlements are added to multiple entitlements (e.g. UEFA Cup matches).

The following carrier media are examples of those used for events with electronic access technology:

- 1 Paper barcode tickets
- 2 Magnetic strip tickets
- 3 Smart Tickets
- 4 Contact-less secure chip cards
- 5 Contact-less secure multi-application cards
- 6 NFC Mobile Devices

The following table shows which products are normally implemented on which carrier media:

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**3 Agreements**

### **3.1 Definition of terms**

#### Application area

the area in which the Technical Guidelines are intended to apply; the highest unit in the terminological structure; incorporates one or more applications, the products/services that belong to those applications, and the application scenarios that result from that

#### Application scenario

A particular way of looking at the application area in terms of the implementation of specific products and services.

#### Operating process

A comprehensive operational procedure in eTicketing. Examples are the sales process, the use of an entitlement, clearing, and so on.

#### Use case

Detailed description of a series of activities that constitute part of an operating process. Examples include initialising a carrier medium and loading an entitlement.

#### Interoperability

Interoperability means that the customer can redeem an entitlement with more than one service provider. The service providers are remunerated for the services provided by the product owner. Accounting accuracy is a central aspect of this, since it determines the money received by the service providers.

#### Usage data

Usage data is generated for particular products and applications whenever an entitlement is used to enter, leave, or re-enter an event. Depending on the application, usage data can be stored in the carrier medium and/or in the access system.

#### Calculation data

The usage data which is used for accounting purposes (for post-paid products, for instance) is referred to as calculation data. Calculation data contains, for example, information about the entitlement, the product owner, the service provider, and the place and time at which the service was used. This data may or may not be able to be assigned to the customer, depending on whether a personalised or anonymous entitlement is being used. The calculation data is passed on to the product owner by the service provider, who gathers it in the terminals. The authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the calculation data are extremely important to customers and service providers alike.

#### Statistical data

Statistical data provides information about the general use of a product, an access, and so on. The statistical data can be derived from the usage data. It is stored and utilised in an anonymised and statistically processed form. Statistical data is not used for invoicing customers for services, but rather for the service provider's or product owner's planning purposes, which is why it is only held in anonymised form.

### <span id="page-15-1"></span><span id="page-15-0"></span>**3.2 Generic modelling of roles and entities**

The roles and responsibilities shall be described on the basis of the ISO 24014 standard.

![](_page_15_Figure_3.jpeg)

#### **Figure 3â1 Entities in an application area as defined by ISO 24014 (but extended to include customer medium entities)**

ISO 24014 defines entities and assigns roles and responsibilities to them. The implementation for the eTicketing for events application area is described in the following:

Actor

An entity that operates in accord with the role assigned to it.

#### Customer

The purchaser of a product and user of the services associated with it. The customer pays money and receives from the product provider an entitlement to use services. This entitlement is redeemed at the service provider.

#### Customer medium

The customer medium is a data carrier in which an electronic entitlement can be stored. The customer medium is held by the customer, and is required by the customer in order to use the entitlement. Other common names for the customer medium are user medium and carrier medium. Examples of customer media include Smart Tickets, chip cards and NFC Mobile Devices.

#### Issuer of customer medium

The issuer of the customer medium configures it for further use. The issuer may market the customer medium through customer media retailers (such as transport companies). Close coordination and a contractual relationship are required between the issuer of the customer medium, the application issuer and the system manager.

#### Provider of customer medium

The provider of the customer medium (e.g. a transport company or mobile phone service provider) markets the customer medium which it has received from the customer medium issuer. The provider of the customer medium normally implements an application as well when issuing the customer medium.

#### Application

The application supports one or more products by providing functions and structures â such as those needed to store entitlements on the carrier medium, in the sales system and in the backend system. The implementation follows the application specification, which normally belongs to the issuer of the application. The issuer of the application may market the application through application providers (such as a regional transport association). As well as the products, the application may also contain customer-specific information.

#### Application issuer

The application issuer is the owner of the application specification. The application issuer may market the application through application providers (e.g. a transport company).

#### Application provider

The application provider (e.g. a transport company or stadium operator) implements and markets the application which it has received from an application issuer (e.g. in licensed form). The application provider also normally issues the carrier medium in conjunction with implementing the application, making him, for instance, the contractual partner to the customer in the eTicketing application area.

#### Product/entitlement/service

The product is a service or object provided by a product owner and which the customer can use in return for payment. The product belongs to the product owner (e.g. a concert organiser) and is offered to customers directly or through a product provider (e.g. travel agent or advance ticket office). When he purchases the product, the customer receives an entitlement to use a service, which he can then redeem at the service provider (e.g. a transport company).

#### Product owner

The owner of the product (e.g. a single entry to a Bundesliga football match). The product owner defines and markets the product, sometimes through a product provider (e.g. an advance ticket office). In simple scenarios, however, it is quite normal for the product owner to be the product provider as well. The product owner must follow the specifications of the application issuer when he defines his product, in order to ensure that the application can support the product. Furthermore, close collaboration is required between the product owner and the service provider who is to provide the service promised by the product. A contractual relationship is required between the product owner, product provider and service provider.

#### Product provider

Markets the product on behalf of the product owner in return for a fee. The product provider receives the customer's payment and is therefore the only interface for payments. This demands direct coordination and a contractual relationship with the product owner. The product provider places the product (e.g. an entitlement) into the application on the carrier medium. The product provider is the contractual partner to the customer in terms of the entitlements he has purchased to utilise services. In organisational terms the product owner often takes on the role of product provider as well.

#### Service provider

Examples include stadium operators and public transport companies. Provides the customer with a service if he presents an entitlement purchased from a product provider (e.g. entry to a stadium). This requires direct coordination and a contractual relationship with the product provider and product owner.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>System manager

The system manager ensures that the rules of the system are upheld. To this end he draws on the functional entities of security manager and registrar.

Registrar

The registrar ensures that the unique identifying characteristics are allocated throughout the system that are needed in order to clearly identify the entities, carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

Security manager

Establishes and coordinates the security regulations in the system. Responsible for approving the components of the system. Monitors the performance of security-related functions (e.g. key management).

### <span id="page-17-2"></span>**3.3 Allocation of roles and entities in the "eTicketing for events" application area**

Making the services available which are described in Chapter [2](#page-12-1) demands, in a fully developed configuration, the interaction of diverse and changing entities. For instance, it must be made possible for a stadium operator to handle applications and products from various different event organisers and providers, since he will be hosting internationals, national league matches and concerts in his stadium.

The assignment of entities in this application area is generally identical to the generic description in section [3.2.](#page-15-1) The special features of this application area are shown in [Figure](#page-17-1)  [3â2](#page-17-1) and then described.

![](_page_17_Figure_10.jpeg)

#### **Figure 3â2 Entities in the "eTicketing for events" application area**

<span id="page-17-1"></span>The following list describes in more detail the roles and aims of the entities involved in this application area. A more precise description of the roles will be made when we look at the product-specific application scenarios.

### <span id="page-18-0"></span>**3.3.1 Event organiser**

The event organiser is responsible for the event and acts as the product owner. He can also assume other roles (but not the role of customer), depending on the application scenario and the context.

The event organiser carries the cost and the commercial and legal risk for the event. His aim is usually to maximise profits. Other aims connected with this are maximum acceptance among customers, that ticket sales processes and the event itself run smoothly, and that costs are minimised.

### **3.3.2 Ticket provider**

Ticket providers assume the role of product provider through various sales channels. The operators of ticket platforms act as product providers for a range of events at different venues, via direct and Internet sales. One example was Internet ticket sales for the 2006 World Cup. In some cases the ticket provider also fulfils other functions. He can, for instance, also be the issuer and provider of the carrier medium and application. In Dutch football, a ticket sales platform provider has established itself which also acts as the system manager, one of whose tasks is to try to ensure that all of the carrier media issued are interoperable with all of the stadiums. Fans can also use their customer media at away games. This is a pioneering model for the future use of contact-less Smart Cards.

As the product provider, the ticket provider is interested in lower sales costs and flexible sales processes. The cost of carrier media, sales points and postage must be minimised. If electronic access control is used at the venue, then the ticket provider must adapt his services to the carrier media and applications that are approved for that system. That is why the standardisation of applications for many venues and the introduction of a system manager in the application area are both advantageous to ticket providers.

Internet platforms are always faced with the problem of postage times, which impede the last-minute sale of entitlements. This can be remedied by solutions such as downloading entitlements via the Internet, or introducing collection procedures.

### **3.3.3 Venue operator**

The places where events are held are often managed independently (e.g. stadium operators). If permanently installed electronic access control is used, then this belongs to the operator, who assumes the role of service provider, since that is where the entitlement purchased from the product provider is converted into a service. In order to operate electronic access control, the operator must be in a position to read and evaluate the application and entitlement on the customer medium; these may in some cases be specific to the event. This requires detailed technical preparations. Various events runs by different event organisers (e.g. league football matches, internationals, concerts, etc.) are normally held at any given venue (e.g. a stadium).

The venue operator â sometimes in collaboration with the event organiser â must ensure that the electronic access control system works properly. Adapting an electronic access control system for specific applications and entitlements is costly and time-consuming; indeed, for individual events it is impossible from an operative and commercial point of view. Yet the operator will be keen to use the existing access technology (and where relevant payment systems, etc.) for all of his events without much adjustment work. The standardisation of applications and entitlements can solve this problem.

### <span id="page-19-0"></span>**3.4 Relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements**

The model described in sections [3.2](#page-15-1) and [3.3](#page-17-2) supports several product retailers, service providers, application owners and so on.

This means that a large number of different carrier media, applications and products would be conceivable.

The customer or carrier medium is the customer's data carrier on which he stores his entitlements and with the help of which he makes use of the associated services.

Applications provide the structures and functions required to load entitlements onto carrier media, and to make use of the entitlements. The implementation of applications must therefore take account of the features of specific carrier media and entitlements.

The customer can exchange entitlements for services at the service provider.

The following rules apply to the relationships between carrier media, applications and entitlements:

- 1 An carrier medium can contain at least one application. If more than one application can be stored on it, then it is referred to as a multi-application-compatible carrier medium.
- 2 An application can store at least one entitlement, and usually several. Personal data and access data may also be stored in the application.
- 3 Applications on one carrier medium can originate from different application owners and retailers.
- 4 Entitlements in one application may originate from different product owners and retailers.
- 5 Entitlements of the same type can be stored in different applications.

The following diagram illustrates an example of the relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>![](_page_20_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 3â3 carrier media, applications and entitlements** 

# <span id="page-21-1"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>**4 General requirements**

The requirements which must be met by the system as a whole and its processes and components can be divided into three categories.

### **4.1 Function**

#### **4.1.1 Customer requirements**

Below are some of the features which are required from the customer's point of view:

- The customer media and systems must be easy to use.
- The customer medium must be durable and reliable, and must perform at a the required speed.
- Data about the event (e.g. starting time, block, row, seat) must be transferred together with the entitlement.
- The entitlement and the customer medium must be easy and reliable to use, including with different service providers.
- It should be possible to replace lost entitlements for an administration fee. The same should apply to exchanging entitlements.
- It must also be possible to purchase anonymous entitlements.
- Reasonable protection must be provided for personal data (where applicable)

Whenever contact-less chip technology is used, the customer should always be kept properly informed of the personal data used, how it is employed, what is done to protect the data, and any risks that remain.

#### **4.1.2 Requirements of the product retailer and service provider**

Functionality

- It should be easy to explain to customers and personnel how the customer medium and systems are used.
- The way the system components and processes are executed must take into account the conditions particular to events. For example, at events that place particularly high demands on the availability of the access technology, entry must be possible even if the terminals go offline temporarily or if the power supply is interrupted.
- It must be possible to blacklist personalised entitlements and customer media, and to issue replacements.
- Access barriers must allow enough people through in a given period. The typical requirement for permanently installed systems is a processing time of 300 ms.

Technical compatibility

â¢ The compatibility of system components must be assured even if carrier media, systems and components come from different manufacturers and retailers and are used with different service providers.

## <span id="page-22-0"></span>**4.2 Economy**

For an eTicketing system to be operated economically, the commercial benefit must be greater than the cost of the processes, systems and security, regardless of how extensively the system is installed. This must apply to all of the actors who invest in the setting-up of the system.

The system as a whole, and its components, should therefore be designed such that the requirements of the relevant application scenarios are met as efficiently as possible. For this reason it is necessary to begin by defining these requirements as accurately as possible.

# **4.3 Security**

This document will deal with the requirements of security separately, from section [8.2](#page-47-1) onwards. Special requirements arise at international sporting events because of the need to separate rival fan groups safely, and to prevent fans that spread violence from entering the stadium.

# <span id="page-23-0"></span>**5 Method of determining security requirements**

### **5.1 Objectives**

The Technical Guidelines on secure use of RFID should fulfil the following objectives:

- Provide system suppliers and system users with an introductory guide on the correct implementation of specific RFID system solutions, in terms of safety, information security and privacy.
- Raise awareness of and achieve transparency in aspects of security.
- Provide a basis for the system supplier's or operator's declaration of conformity, and for the issuing of quality seals by certification authorities.

Achieving these aims requires information which will be provided as follows:

- A definition of the security requirements that must be fulfilled by an RFID system for a given application area.
- A description of the specific risks, appropriate counter-measures, and potential remaining risks.
- A definition of the criteria for a declaration of conformity and for certification.

It is not just security aspects that are relevant to the definition of activities and proposed systems; all of the requirements described in Chapter [4](#page-21-1) also have to be taken into consideration.

### **5.2 Method**

#### **5.2.1 Scope of system considerations**

RFID-based systems can be very complex. In most cases, a lot of components not equipped with RFID are part of the system solution. On the other hand it is not sufficient to look only at the media/tags and readers in order to safeguard the system's security.

The Technical Guidelines must cover in detail every aspect of security relevant to RFID. These aspects depend a lot on the application area and the way the system solution is implemented in it. These Technical Guidelines therefore contain detailed descriptions of the application area and the related operational processes (including the sales channels and processes). The processes cover the entire life-cycle of a carrier medium or transponder. Based on these processes, use cases are identified that are relevant to the security considerations of the RFID system. These use cases are then used as a basis for the identification of threats, and for a detailed system-specific security assessment of RFID-related parts of the system. [Figure 5â1](#page-24-1) shows this approach for the example of eTicketing in public transport.

<span id="page-24-0"></span>![](_page_24_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 5â1 Example: Identification of RFID-relevant use cases for eTicketing** 

<span id="page-24-1"></span>All the other system components are considered only in a fairly general manner. Proposed safeguards follow open standards of IT security.

This concept focuses on those parts of the system that are relevant to RFID, yet still makes sure that all aspects of security are considered. At the same time, the Technical Guidelines leave room for individual and proprietary IT implementations (back-offices, sales systems, logistic systems and so on), which supports the enhancement of existing systems using RFID technology.

### **5.2.2 Scalability and flexibility**

These Technical Guidelines are intended to address security issues primarily. At the same time, any system based on these Guidelines must be economically viable. This means that the following requirements have to be covered by the Guidelines' approach:

- 1 It must be possible to implement systems in such a way that the costs and benefits are balanced. This means in practice that precautionary measures must fulfil but not exceed the need for protection. For example: if only low-cost products are used, which require relatively little protection, then the precautions should be designed accordingly. This may allow the use of low-cost media, reducing in turn the cost of implementation and operation of the system.
- 2 The application scenarios that have been chosen for the Technical Guidelines cover a wide range, from small to nationwide and even international systems. It is important that the concept discussed in the Guidelines can be used for system solutions of any size and complexity.
- 3 In many cases a system solution can be made economically viable much more easily if you are able to cooperate with other companies. This applies in particular to eTicketing applications, where it can be very beneficial if media already available to customers

<span id="page-25-0"></span>(such as multi-application cards and NFC-enabled phones) can be used for additional applications, products and related services.

The following diagrams provide examples of eTicketing for the cross-system and crossapplication utilisation of customer media and infrastructure.

[Figure 5â2](#page-25-1) shows that various products and application scenarios may have to be supported in one system. Furthermore, these products may be hosted by various types of carrier media.

![](_page_25_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5â2 Example of application scenarios and relevant use cases for eTicketing in public transport**

<span id="page-25-1"></span>[Figure 5â3](#page-25-2) gives an example of a customer medium for eTicketing that supports applications from two application areas.

![](_page_25_Figure_8.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5â3 Hierarchical concept for media, applications and tickets in eTicketing**

<span id="page-25-2"></span>The following concept is used in these Technical Guidelines in order to address the aforementioned requirements:

- 1 A feasible role model and the structure of certain key components (products, applications and media) are defined in Chapter 3. This model supports a scalable, extendable approach.
- 2 The Technical Guidelines have to offer security concepts that cover every combination of application scenarios and media used in an infrastructure. This is achieved by individual security assessments based on the relevant use cases.
- <span id="page-26-0"></span>3 Identical application areas (in particular in eTicketing) that provide opportunities for cross-application partnerships will be addressed by the respective Technical Guidelines with as much communality as possible. The security assessments are based on similar security objectives, and the safeguards make use of the same mechanisms wherever possible.
- 4 A special challenge to system security exists in partnerships across systems and applications. It must be ensured that the security of one system is not undermined by the weaknesses of another. Normally this requires extensive security assessments in both systems.

The Technical Guidelines address this problem by introducing a scalable and transparent concept for employing safeguards against the identified threats; these are called "protection demand categories". A total of three categories from 1 (normal demand) to 3 (high demand) are applied. All of the safeguards are divided accordingly into three levels, from normal to advanced protection.

For every individual system implementation, the protection demand category will be defined to begin with, for every security target. These findings will be used to select the appropriate level for the safeguards involved.

This concept provides an easy way to establish secure system cooperation. It remains only to ensure that the protection demand categories of both systems match up.

#### **Table 5â1 Structure of the Technical Guidelines**

#### <span id="page-27-1"></span>**5.2.4 Explanation of the security concept**

Each set of Technical Guidelines contains examples of how security assessments should be applied to particular application scenarios. These can be adapted to the requirements and peripheral conditions of the particular system implementation in hand.

[Figure 5â4](#page-27-2) shows the security assessment concept used in all of the Technical Guidelines.

<span id="page-27-2"></span>**Figure 5â4 Security assessment concept**

# <span id="page-29-2"></span><span id="page-29-0"></span>**6 Generic business processes**

### **6.1 Process P1 "registering and ordering"**

To purchase a ticket product or an entitlement, the customer applies to the ticket retailer. If the customer does not possess a ticket medium containing a suitable application, then he can purchase one from the ticket retailer.[1](#page-29-1) To facilitate this, the ticket retailer works together with the retailers of the application and the customer medium.

Purchasing customer-related entitlements, applications and carrier media requires that the customer registers. To do this the customer provides the necessary personal information (e.g. name, postal address, payment information) and orders the product required.

It is normally up to the event organiser to decide which information is required of the customer for the purposes of determining his identity and address and conducting a credit check. Regulations only apply in the case of special events (e.g. for checking against databases of violent criminals for international football fixtures).

Orders can be placed through various channels:

1 Sales point

The customer visits the sales point and orders the product. Payment is made there and then. Ideally, the sales point will have direct access to the eTicketing system and be able to issue products and customer media on the spot. If not, they are delivered by post. Personal data is only required if a customer-specific product is ordered, or if postal delivery is required.

Where necessary, identity and personal data are checked by means such as an identity card.

2 Service centre

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by fax, written application or telephone. The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by telephone. Payment is made by credit card, direct debit, etc. Customer media are delivered by post, or made ready for collection at the venue (sales point, vending machine).

Personal and address information submitted by fax or phone is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed. The organiser then relies on checking the people as they come in, and comparing the ticket data at the venue.

3 Internet

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by Internet (website). The availability of the product and factors such as choice of seating can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is made by credit card, direct debit, etc. Customer media are delivered by post, or made ready for collection at the venue (sales point, vending machine).

<span id="page-29-1"></span><sup>1</sup> The case of a customer who only wants to purchase a customer medium with an application, but no product, is considered irrelevant and is not discussed here.

<span id="page-30-0"></span>Personal and address information submitted via the Internet is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed. The organiser then relies on procedures such as randomly checking the people as they come in, and comparing the ticket data at the venue.

4 Internet using card-readers and secure proof of identity

In future there will be another way for customers to register and place orders.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (website). Personal data (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and an electronic proof of identity (eID), which may take the form of the elektronischer Personalausweis (ePA) or electronic identity card.

The availability of the product and factors such as choice of seating can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is made by credit card, direct debit, etc. Products and customer media are delivered by post, or made ready for collection at the venue (sales point, vending machine).

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID is to be considered trustworthy. Additional checking is not required.

The following diagram shows Process P1A, registering and ordering:

![](_page_30_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 6â1 Process P1A "registering and ordering"** 

### <span id="page-31-2"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>**6.2 Process P2 "producing and delivering products"**

Two basic cases are to be considered when describing the process of producing and delivering products:

- 1 Producing and delivering an entitlement together with a specially produced carrier medium.
- 2 Loading an entitlement onto a customer-related medium already in the possession of the customer (e.g. secure chip card, NFC Mobile Device).

The following diagram, [Figure 6â2](#page-31-1), shows Process P2 with 4 sub-processes. Processes P2.1 to P2.3 cover the former case â in which the ordered product is delivered to the customer on a specially produced medium.

![](_page_31_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 6â2 Process P2 "producing and delivering"** 

<span id="page-31-1"></span>Explanation of terms:

Initialisation

Initialising a carrier medium involves configuring it for the first time, and/or loading on applications.

#### Personalising

Personalising refers to the allocation of an carrier medium, application or entitlement to a natural person. Personal data is loaded onto it for this purpose.

<span id="page-32-0"></span>Loading entitlements

Loading entitlements onto an existing application on the carrier medium.

### **6.3 Process P3 "using an entitlement"**

An event-specific entitlement is redeemed by the customer in exchange for a service at the event. If an electronic access system exists at the venue, then the customer must have an carrier medium with an application approved for the event and a valid entitlement in order to gain entry, claim his seat, and so on.

The electronic access system is the responsibility of the operator of the venue. The operator must first do a number of things before the event so as to guarantee the operation of this function:

- 1 The local access system must be adapted to the applications and entitlements that are being used for the event. Because of the different RD-media involved and so on, this may well involve more than one application for a given event.
- 2 The event-specific key information must be integrated into the local key management system if contact-less chip technology is being used.
- 3 The list of enabled entitlements (the whitelist) and blocked entitlements (the blacklist) must be transferred from the ticket system into the access system, which requires a realtime data interface between the ticket retailer's or event organiser's ticket system and the operator's access system.

A local service or info desk must be set up at the venue as a point of contact in the event of problems that may occur with media or entitlements when entering. It should be possible to produce carrier media and entitlements for the event at this service or info desk, which requires direct access to the ticketing system and the access control system, as well as a means of producing media and entitlements.

Access is via turnstiles. Alternatively it is possible to employ marshals with mobile readers at the entrances. The inspection units and turnstiles also have to work if the stadium network fails. This is especially important if a WLAN is used for connecting to the access server.

The ticket is activated when the customer enters. Optionally, there should be way of leaving the venue and re-entering.

![](_page_33_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-33-0"></span>The following diagram shows Process P3:

**Figure 6â3 Process P3 "using an entitlement"** 

This does not take into account faults that occur when entering.

### **6.4 Process P4 "blacklisting entitlements and carrier media"**

Because of the high level of security against falsification that can be achieved if chip-based carrier media are utilised properly, it is possible to blacklist entitlements and carrier media securely. This helps the processes of cancelling and exchanging carrier media and entitlements, and enables lost media to be replaced. The following are possible scenarios:

1 Defective carrier media are withdrawn and destroyed. The same applies to the cancellation of a single ticket. Before issuing a replacement medium it is important to ascertain that a counterfeit has not been presented for replacement, and that a medium has not been declared as defective and submitted.

- 2 In practice, mislaid carrier media can only be blacklisted and replaced if they are personalised, i.e. assigned to a customer account (see registration) with a ticket retailer. If this is the case, then the owner can identify himself to the ticket retailer from which he obtained the medium, and state which carrier medium is to be blacklisted. The same procedure can be used to cancel single entitlements.
- 3 Mislaid personalised carrier media and the entitlements stored on them can be replaced provided that all the entitlements on them have been blacklisted. It is important to remember that the carrier medium may contain more than one application, and that these may themselves contain entitlements from various ticket retailers.

# <span id="page-35-1"></span><span id="page-35-0"></span>**7 Use Cases**

The following sections contain descriptions of use cases that are relevant as we look further at contact-less chip technology in this application area. These use cases have been derived from the generic operating processes described in Chapter [6](#page-29-2).

The descriptions of the use cases are based on an illustrative system architecture which is discussed in more detail in Chapter [10](#page-102-1).

### **7.1 Use case "Identification when registering and ordering"**

The quality of the process of authenticating and identifying the customer is crucial to the reliability of the data upon which Process P1, "Registering and ordering", is based. Process descriptions P1.1 â P1.4 can be used for elucidating this. Using a reliable process, such as one involving a secure personalised customer medium or an electronic identification medium (possibly the forthcoming ePA, for example), will mean an increase in security and functionality.

### <span id="page-35-2"></span>**7.2 Use case "carrier medium initialisation"**

The "carrier medium initialisation" use case depicted in [Figure 7â1](#page-36-1) incorporates the following steps:

- 1 carrier medium initialisation
- 2 Default settings relating to function and security
- 3 Setting specific keys
- 4 Setting an ID which uniquely identifies the carrier medium
- 5 Loading the applications
- 6 Loading the software specific to the applications concerned
- 7 Allocating the resources of the carrier medium (setting up file systems and so on)
- 8 Setting specific keys for each application
- 9 Loading the application-specific data
- 10 Loading customer data (where required)
- 11 Loading the ID of the application retailer

As the stages of initialising the carrier medium progress, the information in the management system for carrier media and applications has to be updated.

The various keys, certificates and so on that are used are generated and fed in by a key management system. This system is the responsibility of the system manager (more precisely the security manager and registrar). If the carrier medium's chip is to generate public keys during initialisation, then these also have to be fed into the key management system.

carrier medium initialisation normally takes place in a secure environment (e.g. in a mass personaliser or in a vending machine).

<span id="page-36-0"></span>![](_page_36_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â1 Use case "carrier medium initialisation"** 

### <span id="page-36-2"></span><span id="page-36-1"></span>**7.3 Use case "Application loading"**

The "Application loading" use case shown in [Figure 7â2](#page-37-1) illustrates the procedure for loading an application onto an carrier medium already in the possession of a customer. The medium can be a contact-less chip card or an NFC Mobile Device.

There are various possible scenarios for loading a new application onto an existing carrier medium:

- 1 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in a trustworthy environment.
- 2 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in an insecure environment. For instance, this may occur when loading an application onto a contact-less chip card via a reader on a home computer or in an advance ticket office.
- 3 Loading an application "over-the-air" onto an NFC Mobile Device.

<span id="page-37-0"></span>![](_page_37_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â2 Use case "Application loading"** 

### <span id="page-37-2"></span><span id="page-37-1"></span>**7.4 Use case "Entitlement loading"**

As soon as the carrier medium has been initialised and the applications installed, entitlements can be loaded onto the applications.

The sale of products is directly dependent on this use case being performed securely and in a way which is easy for customers. The use case is therefore an absolutely crucial one for retailers and customers alike. All of the sales channels discussed in the description of Process P2 (Section [6.2](#page-31-2)) must be taken into consideration when dealing with the "Entitlement loading" use case depicted in [Figure 7â3](#page-38-1).

<span id="page-38-0"></span>![](_page_38_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â3 Use case "Entitlement loading"** 

<span id="page-38-1"></span>A distinction must be made between the loading of entitlements when the carrier medium is first issued and the loading of entitlements later on. The latter can be done via the Internet using a home reader, over-the-air onto an NFC Mobile Device, or locally at a sales point or vending machine.

### **7.5 Use case "Delivery"**

carrier media that have been initialised and loaded with entitlements must then be passed to the delivery point or the customer as described in Process P2 (Section [6.2\)](#page-31-2).

When delivering, the product retailer must also record security-relevant information about the delivery in the ticket system. This includes:

- 1 Addressee,
- 2 ID of carrier media, ID of products,
- 3 Forwarder,
- 4 Delivery point, special arrangements relating to handing-over.

### **7.6 Use case "Entering an event"**

The "Entering an event" use case represents the first part of Process P3.2 in detail. The exact way this is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

**Figure 7â4 Use Case "Entering an event"** 

In the event of a fault, manual clearing is used. Usually this means that a marshal takes the customer to a service desk, where defective carrier media can be exchanged if necessary.

### **7.7 Use Case "Leaving an event with the right to return"**

The "Leaving an event with the right to return" use case represents the second part of Process P3.2 in detail. The exact way this is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

**Figure 7â5 Use Case "Leaving an event with the right to return"** 

In the event of a fault, manual clearing is used. Usually this means that a marshal takes the customer to a service desk, where defective carrier media can be exchanged if necessary.

### **7.8 Use case "Blacklisting"**

Carrier media that have been mislaid must be able to be blacklisted. The same applies to defective media and entitlements, assuming they cannot be withdrawn and destroyed.

The blacklisting of a medium and/or the entitlement stored on it is a precondition for the issuing of a replacement medium, or for the transfer of an entitlement to a new owner with a different customer medium.

Blacklisting can only be performed if it is sufficiently certain that the customer requesting it is the rightful owner of the medium or entitlement. That is why customers may only blacklist media or entitlements in either of the following cases:

- <span id="page-41-0"></span>1 The customer's details were stored when purchasing. Blacklisting is then performed following reliable identification and a legally binding declaration that the customer agrees to the procedure.
- 2 The medium containing the entitlement is presented. Its authenticity can be determined securely.

As well as customers performing blacklisting, other entities in the system can apply for it too. To this end, responsibilities and processes are defined for these entities in the system as a whole.

**Figure 7â6 Use case "Blacklisting"** 

### **7.9 Use cases "Key management"**

For performance reasons, entitlements on carrier media are usually protected using procedures involving symmetric keys. The security and proper function of the system as a whole is therefore highly dependent on the secure provision and storage of the keys, a job which has to be done by the key management system and the processes assigned to it.

In the following use cases, Secure Authentication Modules (SAMs) are used as secure storage for key information, security mechanisms and diversification algorithms. In principle, other methods may also be feasible.

<span id="page-42-0"></span>Carrier medium initialisation and the loading of entitlements require a key management system that recognises the hierarchical relationship between carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

For the sake of simplicity, the following diagrams only show the process of ordering SAMs for the first time. In practice re-ordering will be frequent, and this will have to be dealt with accordingly, normally using master keys that are already available.

### **7.9.1 Key management for the initialisation of carrier media**

[Figure 7â7](#page-42-1) illustrates the use case of key management for the initialisation of carrier media. The keys and procedures defined here are also required for the loading of applications.

### <span id="page-42-2"></span><span id="page-42-1"></span>**7.9.2 Key management for loading and personalising applications**

In order to secure applications that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the applications.

[Figure 7â8](#page-43-1) shows the corresponding use case. The key management system for carrier media also has to be available when the application is loaded onto the carrier medium.

In order to secure entitlements that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the products.

[Figure 7â9](#page-44-1) shows the corresponding use case. The key management system for applications also has to be available when the entitlement is loaded onto the application.

**Figure 7â9 Use case "Key management for products/entitlements"** 

#### <span id="page-44-1"></span>**7.9.4 Key management for use with the event organiser**

Retailers and issuers require a key management system to initialise carrier media and issue entitlements.

The organiser of the event requires the keys and other information needed to read and evaluate the entitlements.

This information has to be available in the inspection system.

To this end, the security manager normally generates and issues specific SAMs (service provider SAMs) for the organiser using the key management system. Service provider SAMs can contain key information from multiple retailers of products, applications and carrier media. A selection is put together by the security manager in accordance with the needs of the organiser.

### **8.1 Definitions relating to security and privacy**

Security can be divided into three aspects or categories, all of which this document intends to examine. They are:

- Safety
- Information security
- Privacy

These categories can be subdivided as follows:

1 Safety

Safety is not to be confused with reliability/correctness or quality of service. Reliability means that the system works correctly according to its specifications. Experience shows that every technical system is sometimes subject to failure. Safety is understood as the capacity of a system, when it does fail, not to enter uncontrollable states that would endanger the system itself or its environment (fail-safe). At the same time, the system should also continue to respond as far as possible in compliance with its specification (fault tolerance). Safety, therefore, basically implies protection against unintended incidents.

2 Information security

Unlike safety, information security offers protection against intentional attacks. In the field of information security, security targets can be formulated as belonging to the following categories:

- a Confidentiality: confidentiality means protection against the unauthorised disclosure of information. Confidential data and information may only be accessible to authorised people in an authorised manner. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against access by unauthorised persons.
- b Integrity: integrity means ensuring that data is correct (intact) and that systems function properly. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against unauthorised modification.
- c Availability: the availability of services, of the functions of an IT system, IT applications and IT networks â and also of information â exists if these things are always available to their users when required. Formulated as a protection target this means: information and operating systems are to be protected against being withheld improperly.
- d Unlinkability: if two communication elements within a system are unlinkable, it means they are not any more or less related to one another than is already known and established. Within the system, no further information about the relationship between these communication elements can be obtained. In practical terms this means that a single user can make use of services and resources more than one time, without third parties being able to see that these access events (in the communication model: messages) are related through the user.
- e Unobservability: an event is unobservable if it cannot be determined whether it has happened or not. Sender-unobservability means it cannot be seen that anything has been sent; recipient-unobservability is the same: it is not possible to ascertain

that something has been received. Relationship-unobservability means that it cannot be seen that anything is sent from the group of possible senders to the group of possible recipients.

- f Anonymity: anonymity is the condition of being unidentifiable within one's anonymity group. Using the term unlinkability, anonymity can be more precisely defined as the unlinkability of the identity of a user and an event initiated by that user. Senderanonymity is therefore unlinkability of sender and message, and recipientanonymity is the unlinkability of message and recipient.
- g Authenticity: the term authenticity designates a situation in which the partner in a communication process is actually the person he claims to be. Authentic information is information that genuinely comes from the stated source. The term is not only used when people's identity is being checked, but also for IT components and applications.
- h Non-repudiation: protection should exist against the possibility of denying that messages have been sent and received by persons whose authenticity has been determined.
- i Binding validity: binding validity joins together the IT security targets of authenticity and non-repudiation. When transmitting information this means that the source of the information has proven its identity, and that the receipt of the message cannot be disputed.
- 3 Privacy

The purpose of privacy is to protect against infringements of the personal rights of the individual through the handling of his personal data.

Privacy refers to the protection of personal data against possible misuse by third parties (not to be confused with data security).

The following additional terms will also be used throughout:

1 Security targets

Security targets are the security-related and safety-related objectives undertaken when setting up an IT system. This document lays down specific security targets within the areas of use and application scenarios. Infringing upon the security targets causes direct damage to the entity whose security target is violated.

2 Threats

Threats are immediate risks to the security targets of an application.

These may be the result of an active attack on one or more security targets, or they may take the form of potential vulnerabilities in the system such as the lack of a fallback solution.

3 Safeguards

Safeguards are actual recommended actions that counter one or more threats. The safeguards described in this document are intended to be applied meaningfully and according to need, which means they are suggested on the basis of economic feasibility and resistance to manipulation: how expensive is a safeguard, and what are the financial damages that it can limit or prevent?

4 Residual risk

Generally speaking it is not possible to counteract every single threat in such a way that a system offers perfect security. The residual risk is thus the risk of potential attack that remains after a series of safeguards have been put in place. The extent of this risk depends on the counter-measures that can be applied, how complex they are, and, above all, what the costs are in relation to the benefits for the entity involved. The entity has to take explicit liability for the residual risk.

### <span id="page-47-1"></span><span id="page-47-0"></span>**8.2 Definition of the security targets**

It would be very unusual indeed for all of the safety aspects relating to safety, information security and privacy within a given application scenario to be of equal importance, or indeed for every single one of them to be relevant at all. The first challenge when designing a secure RFID system is therefore to formulate specific security targets.

Within the areas of use relating to eTicketing, certain higher level security targets specific to the application area can be recognised, based on the generic security targets mentioned earlier:

- 1 Protection of electronic entitlements (represents the protection targets integrity and authenticity)
- 2 Safety of the RFID system
- 3 Protection of the customer's privacy (represents the protection targets confidentiality, unlinkability, unobservability, anonymity, and privacy as a general requirement)

The subsidiary security targets summarised in Section [8.2.4](#page-53-1) can be derived from the assessments of the entities' security targets contained in the following sections.

### <span id="page-54-1"></span><span id="page-54-0"></span>**8.2.5 Formation of protection demand categories**

Three protection demand categories are formed on the basis of the security targets described in Section [8.2.4](#page-53-1). Category 1 represents the lowest protection demand, category 3 the highest.

The following table lists the criteria for allocating protection requirements to protection demand categories, these criteria being based on the assumption that no protective measures have been put in place.

**Table 8â18 Threats to the sales, inspection and backend systems** 

## <span id="page-62-1"></span><span id="page-62-0"></span>**8.4 Safeguards**

This section describes the safeguards that can be used to counter the threats detailed in Section 8.3. These safeguards are defined in such a way that, when built successively upon each other, they afford increasing levels of security â in cases where different levels are possible. Level 1 represents the lowest security category, level 3 the highest.

Level 3+ is used to denote additional safeguards that increase the security of a system, but whose cost is excessive in proportion to the extra security gained.

The security levels are oriented around the system's protection demand categories. A threat to a security target that has been allocated to protection demand category 3 should be countered by safeguards of security level 3. Threats within a given protection demand category can generally be countered by means of safeguards from the same or a higher protection category.

The following safeguards are generally not defined as isolated measures, but rather are to be understood as "safeguard packages". As a rule, the security of components and interfaces, and of the system as a whole, can only be increased in a meaningful way if safeguards are employed across the board as packages. Furthermore, alternative possibilities are defined within the security levels; for instance, a secure environment (which generally does not exist) can replace the encrypted storage of data.

#### **8.4.1 Selection of cryptographic processes**

In the following descriptions of safeguards, cryptographic processes as defined in [ALGK\_BSI] are required for new implementations. [ALGK\_BSI] defines suitable processes, suitable key lengths and the predicted life-span of these processes. [ALGK\_BSI] is revised and published by the BSI at appropriate intervals.

Existing implementations should always satisfy [ALGK\_BSI] or [TR\_eCARD]. In the next evolutionary step of a given implementation, [ALGK\_BSI] should be applied. This step should be taken within an appropriate period of time.

The TDES algorithm may be applied to existing system for authentication, encryption and MAC-formation, given the aforementioned conditions.

### <span id="page-63-0"></span>**8.4.2 Safeguards for the protection of the system as a whole**

The following safeguards relate to the system as a whole, the focus being on the sales, inspection and management systems, including the associated interfaces.

Separate sections will deal with the RF interface; readers installed in terminals, vending machines and so on; carrier media; and the key management system.

|         | Emulation requires that the complete data content and the full function of the<br>carrier medium, including UID, can be retrieved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                   |

|       | ISO 7816-13 commands must be executed using secure messaging. This en<br>sures that the new application is authentic when loaded, and can be operated<br>securely. The following section looks more closely at the application of this ISO<br>standard to this use case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                   |  |

| 1   | Key management concept and implementation<br>â¢<br>Keys are given unique IDs.<br>â¢<br>The purpose of the key and the entity to which it belongs is uniquely identi<br>fied (e.g. product retailer ID, application ID, service provider ID).<br>â¢<br>Algorithms for generating keys are to be selected in accordance with<br>[ALGK_BSI] (preferential) and [TR_ECARD].<br>â¢<br>Static keys can only be used in bordered-off, clearly manageable areas<br>where it is easy for the main components to exchange keys, and where the<br>number of carrier media no longer usable after the exchange is low. If a<br>static method is used, then a secure key reloading process must be defined<br>at the same time which enables keys on the carrier medium to be replaced.<br>We therefore recommend the use of derived keys and unique identification<br>numbers (e.g. chip card ID, UID and a master key). This generates unique<br>keys for each component.<br>â¢<br>The key length used is chosen and specified separately for each function.<br>[ALGK_BSI] should generally be applied.<br>â¢<br>Keys in readers should always be stored in encapsulated security modules<br>(SAMs). This applies especially to terminals, inspection units and vending<br>machines that can work offline. Keys in backend systems should also pref<br>erably be stored in security modules such as SAMs.<br>â¢<br>Keys can be distributed in two ways:<br>â¢<br>personalisation of keys in carrier media and components in a secure<br>environment, and<br>â¢<br>loading new keys (see MK8 â reloading process)<br>â¢<br>The key management system is designed by the system manager. The enti<br>ties involved apply a key management concept. This includes nominating<br>people responsible for key management who ensure that it is performed<br>correctly, and who keep abreast of the latest cryptographic developments<br>so as to be able to counteract threats to the system as a whole in good<br>time. |                   |

This effectively prevents messages<br>from being eavesdropped or re-sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |

| 3       | â¢<br>Regular and emergency versions of every key are stored in the SAMs and<br>carrier media.

|         | â¢<br>Every time an RFID carrier medium communicates with the terminal, the<br>emergency version is used instead of the regular version â assuming this<br>has not already happened. To this end, suitable mechanisms must be main<br>tained in the carrier medium that prevent the regular version from being<br>used later.                    |                        |  |
|         | â¢<br>If the security modules are altogether compromised and an emergency ver<br>sion of the key is not available, then the security modules and therefore the<br>carrier media must be replaced immediately. The data in the system cannot<br>be considered trustworthy until all the security modules and carrier media<br>have been replaced. |                        |  |

# <span id="page-95-0"></span>**9 Definition of product-specific application scenarios**

We will now examine the processes described in Chapters [6](#page-29-2) and [7](#page-35-1) to provide examples of how particular products can be implemented.

The following products will be discussed:

- 1 Non-personalised single entitlement for entry, with seat number
- 2 Personalised single entitlement for entry, with seat number
- 3 Personalised season entitlement, with seat number

This combination covers most of the possible scenarios in the field of events. From them it is easy to derive conclusions about simpler application scenarios such as non-personalised entitlements. A combination of products of this type could occur for events such as a Champions League match or an opera performance.

The selected application scenarios will be discussed for these products in more detail in the following sections.

### **9.1 Application scenario: "Non-personalised single entitlement"**

#### Entitlement

Purchasing this product entitles the customer to a single entry to an event, and to use a particular seat.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value of a single entitlement is normally between â¬15 and â¬100. If this value is exceeded and reaches, for instance, the level of a season ticket, then appropriate solutions should be used.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media can be used to carry the entitlement:

#### **Table 9â1 carrier media used for single entitlements**

The cost of carrier media is of great importance to the organiser and ticket retailer. The cost of the medium must be commensurate with the value of the entitlement. That is why product retailers normally only issue single entitlements on Smart Tickets with cheap memory chips.

Loading applications and entitlements onto customer media that already exist eliminates the cost of the medium altogether. However, loading an additional application onto a multiapplication card does require special security precautions and a special infrastructure.

The secure chip card enables entitlements to be loaded onto existing applications, but does not enable applications to be loaded later on after production. Multi-application cards and NFC Mobile Devices, however, do allow applications to be loaded at a later stage.

**Table 9â3 carrier media used for personalised single entitlements** 

The cost of carrier media is of great importance to the organiser and ticket retailer. The cost of the medium must be commensurate with the value of the entitlement. That is why product retailers normally only issue single entitlements on Smart Tickets with cheap memory chips.

Loading applications and entitlements onto customer media that already exist eliminates the cost of the medium altogether. However, loading an additional application onto a multiapplication card does require special security precautions and a special infrastructure.

The secure chip card enables entitlements to be loaded onto existing applications, but does not enable applications to be loaded later on after production. Multi-application cards and NFC Mobile Devices, however, do allow applications to be loaded at a later stage.

### **9.3 Application scenario: "Personalised season entitlement"**

#### Entitlement

Purchasing this product entitles a particular customer to enter â for example â all of the league matches in a season, and to use a particular seat.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value of a season entitlement is normally between â¬200 and â¬500.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media can be used to carry the entitlement:

That is why product retailers normally issue single entitlements on secure chip cards. If other applications are to be used at the venue, then it may make sense to issue multi-application cards.

This Chapter describes, as an example, the entire system for the "eTicketing for events" application area.

The overall system is made up of the eTicketing infrastructure and the carrier media. The term eTicketing infrastructure refers collectively to all of the system components and associated interfaces installed by the product retailers, service providers and system manager.

The solution presented here can cover the aforementioned role descriptions, processes and application scenarios in their maximum complexity. Variations on it are conceivable in the case of specialised implementations in actual use. In particular, simplification of the role model, and reductions in the number of different media, applications, products, and of the entities involved, would also enable simplifications of the system and the processes.

The focus of these considerations and of the suggestions regarding safeguards is on the implementation of the RFID interface and the directly connected components carrier medium and reader. The safeguards for carrier media are heavily dependent on the application scenario concerned, and various versions of these safeguards will be presented in Chapter [11](#page-133-1). Section [10.2](#page-128-1) contains general information on carrier media.

The following diagram shows the system as a whole and its principal components.

#### <span id="page-103-1"></span>**10.1.1 Determining the protection demand for the eTicketing infrastructure**

The following general considerations are examples that apply to the eTicketing infrastructure, and these should be included when determining the protection requirements:

- 1 The systems in [Figure 10â1](#page-102-2) should simultaneously support a range of different products and carrier media, as defined in the application scenarios proposed in Chapter 9.
- 2 Data relating to particular persons must be managed and processed.
- 3 Usage data will be generated and must be processed.
- 4 Calculation data must be logged and forwarded between the entities. Interoperability is required.
- 5 People known to be willing to commit violent acts must be excluded from sales and entry.

These criteria represent an eTicketing infrastructure which can integrate several different organisers and venues, and which would, for example, enable the organisation of international football matches.

On the basis of the criteria described in Section [8.2.5](#page-54-1), the eTicketing infrastructure can be assigned to the following protection demand categories:

|     | Security target                                        | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                            |                                                     |

### <span id="page-106-0"></span>**10.1.2 Interfaces in the system as a whole**

The system shown in [Figure 10â1](#page-102-2) is reliant on interaction between all the system components. In order to facilitate the business processes described in Chapter [6](#page-29-2), the technical interfaces and operative interaction between the components have to be specified.

Furthermore, agreements must be made between the entities to regulate the responsibilities and the operational procedures.

#### **10.1.2.1 Threats relevant to the eTicketing infrastructure**

#### **10.1.2.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **10.1.3 Readers**

Readers control the flow of information for reading from and writing to the carrier medium, using a contact-less communication protocol. The reader (PCD as defined by ISO/IEC14443) assumes the active role (master), while the carrier medium (PICC as defined by ISO/IEC14443) is passive (slave).

Readers are integrated into various system components:

- 1 Sales systems at sales points
- 2 Vending machines
- 3 Service desks
- 4 Stationary terminals for checking entitlements when entering, and in some cases when leaving the venue and returning again.
- 5 Mobile inspection units

#### **10.1.3.1 Threats relevant to the readers**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the assumptions used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-103-1)

#### **Table 10â7 Safeguards for the reader and its applications**

#### **10.1.3.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **10.1.4 Sale, inspection and management systems**

#### **10.1.4.1 Sales systems**

Access to the products must be easy and inexpensive for all potential customers, which is why a range of points of sale should be supported. These are described in the following:

#### **Sales point**

This could be, for instance, the office of a football club (product owner / organiser) or an advance sales office (product retailer).

#### Sales procedure

The customer visits the sales point in person and purchases the product there:

- Identification, if required, is by identity card.
- The booking is done in dialogue with the customer at the sales point.
- Payment is made at the sales point.

If the carrier medium can be produced on site or the entitlement loaded onto an existing customer medium (see "Technical equipment"), then the customer can take the product away with him straight away. If not, then the product and the carrier medium are sent by post or held at the sales point, ready for subsequent collection.

#### Technical equipment

The sales point has direct access to the ticket sales system. This is a precondition for services such as seat reservation.

In many cases it makes commercial sense to equip a sales point with a ticket printer and a contact-less reader which can initialise certain RD-media and load entitlements onto them.

Furthermore, a simple contact-less reader at the sales point can provide an economical way of loading entitlements onto an existing customer medium. If such a contact-less reader exists, then in future it could become possible to utilise an electronic proof of identity as a means of securely and automatically transferring personal data into the ticket system (e.g. for setting up a customer account), or for secure identification.

The personnel and IT infrastructure at the sales point are not always trustworthy.

#### Vending and collection machines

At vending machines, products are sold and issued in a direct interaction between the vending machine and the customer.

Vending machines are preferably set up at the venue or at places frequented by customers. They are especially suitable for: selling products that are very popular but that do not require complex procedures to order or produce; for box-office sales on the day; and for products ordered over the Internet or telephone. In the latter case, vending machines mean customers do not have wait for the product to be delivered by post, and they also mean that Internet sales are possible up to just before the event.

#### Selling personalised products

There is currently no way of identifying a customer for the first time securely and automatically. That is why a vending machine cannot perform registration as described under Process P1A, and a customer account cannot be set up. This may change with the use of the electronic identity card.

However, it is possible to load new entitlements onto customer media belonging to known customers who already own personalised customer media. In such cases, identification can be done using the existing customer medium itself.

#### Selling anonymous products

In the simplest cases, anonymous carrier media and entitlements are sold at vending machines.

The customer purchases or collects the product at a vending machine:

- Booking is done at the vending machine.
- Payment is made directly using methods such as Maestro or credit cards.
- When collecting, identification is by means of the customer's own medium or using electronic means of identity (eID).

The carrier medium for the product purchased is produced there and then. Alternatively, the entitlement can be loaded onto an existing customer medium (see "Technical equipment"). The customer can take the product away with him straight away.

Collecting pre-ordered products

Vending machines can serve as issuing points for products ordered by Internet or telephone.

If the vending machine is used for collecting pre-ordered entitlements, then the orderer must always identify himself. If the customer possesses his own customer medium then this can be used for identification and for storing the entitlement. If not, then other processes must be used for identification (e.g. credit card or eID).

#### Technical equipment

The vending machine requires direct access to the ticket sales system, at least for some of the time. Another condition is that it must incorporate a ticket printer with an in-built reader which can initialise the carrier media issued, and load entitlements onto them.

If the machine is to be able to load entitlements onto existing customer media, then uninterrupted access is required to the ticket sales system and the management system for carrier media and applications. A compatible reader must also be installed in the vending machine.

Internet, call centres, ordering by post

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order by telephone, Internet or fax from any location:

- The booking, choice of seat etc. can be made in a direct interaction when using the Internet or telephone. Written orders do not allow this.
- Payment is made by Maestro, credit card or direct debit.
- For secure identification, the personal data sent by the customer may have to be checked.

The carrier medium and product are produced centrally and sent by post. Alternatively it can be agreed that the product will be collected somewhere such as an issuing point or vending machine.

#### Technical equipment

The product retailer requires an Internet sales platform or a call centre. The customer does not require any particular technical equipment.

The carrier medium and product can be produced using a mass personaliser in a secure environment.

Internet

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order interactively by Internet from any location (e.g. at home).

If the customer has a customer medium which already contains the necessary application, then the required product can be loaded onto it. If a chip card is being used, then a contactless reader is required â such as one that works with a home computer, for example. If an NFC Mobile Device is to be used as the customer medium, then the product can also be loaded over the air:

- <span id="page-115-0"></span>â¢ Booking, seat reservation and so on can be done in a direct interaction when using the Internet.
- Identification is done using the customer medium and the personal data stored in the application.
- Payment is made using Maestro, credit card or direct debit.

The entitlement is loaded directly into the application on the customer medium.

If the customer does not yet have a customer medium but does have a contact-less reader, then secure identification of the customer will in future be able to take place using an electronic means of identity, thus enabling the customer medium to be ordered securely and conveniently.

#### Technical equipment

The product provider operates an Internet sales platform, which is connected to the key, carrier and application management systems. The customer requires a customer medium, and â if a chip card or electronic means of identity is being used â a contact-less home reader device.

#### **10.1.4.2 Ticket system**

The ticket system supports the primary selling and handling processes:

- 1 Registering and ordering
- 2 Creating the entitlement
- 3 Payment, and checking creditworthiness
- 4 Managing the entitlements sold
- 5 Forwarding the necessary data to the inspection system

Customer data and orders are stored in the ticket system. Provided the transport service and product support it, seating can also be allocated using seating plans which are also stored there. The ticket system also incorporates a procedural management system which performs actions such as address comparisons and payment processing including credit checks, and which also initiates the production and dispatch of carrier media and entitlements.

<span id="page-116-0"></span>![](_page_116_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 10â2 An example of a ticket system with possible process flows** 

A ticket system has interfaces to the key management system and the system which administers the carrier media and applications. All of the information required to enter a special event (apart from the information transferred in the key management system) is gathered together by the ticket system and sent to the service provider via a defined interface.

There are other interfaces to the sales points and the places where the carrier media are produced. This also includes sales and distribution, and the management of loading applications and products onto existing media via the Internet.

It can be assumed that a ticket system will be housed in a secure environment. Personaliser SAMs must be connected to it in order to be able to produce entitlements and load them onto carrier media.

From the point of view of the service provider, more than one ticket system can be used for each event.

#### **10.1.4.3 Central inspection system**

The inspection system helps the service provider to check the customers' entitlements to enter an event, and to gather and pass on information relevant to invoicing. This requires the following functions:

- <span id="page-117-0"></span>1 Support of Process P3 for entry, activation and, if applicable, re-entry.
- 2 Support for the carrier media, applications and products particular to the event.
	- a Implementation of the technical procedures required to support the carrier media, applications and products that are approved for the specific event.
	- b Implementation and administration of key management system.
- 3 Control of terminals (turnstiles, mobile inspection terminals, etc).
- 4 Receiving, distributing and utilising the information provided by the ticket systems.
- 5 Receiving, distributing and utilising the keys and identifiers provided by the system manager and registrar.
- 6 Reporting calculation-related data and usage history to the ticket systems.

The access system may be required to work even if the data network linking the central system and terminals at the entrances should fail. That means all of the information required for entry, evaluation and activation of entitlements, and where applicable re-entry, has to be stored locally in the terminals.

#### **10.1.4.4 Terminals**

The job of a terminal is to read, evaluate and if necessary activate the entitlement when the customer enters the venue, and possibly when he exits and re-enters it. A contact-less reader is integrated into the terminal.

In normal operation, stationary terminals connect daily for at least a certain amount of time to the central inspection system via a data network (LAN or WLAN). Information required to evaluate the entitlements is updated constantly in this way. Usage data is also sent by that means from the terminal to the central system.

If the system is required to have a particularly high level of availability, then all of the functions required communicating with the carrier media and applications will have to be supported locally in the terminal itself. This can incur considerable costs if new technologies have to be introduced.

It is therefore sensible, when defining applications, to base communication protocols, cryptographic methods etc. on open, standardised processes and to rely on flexible, hardwareindependent methods of implementation.

As well as the application-specific functions, all of the information specific to particular events that is required to evaluate the entitlement must be stored locally in the terminal (e.g. product retailer ID, service provider ID, carrier medium ID, application ID, product IP, various levels of keys, blacklists). It must also be possible to store the access history temporarily in the terminal.

The security-related safeguards for the reader incorporated into the terminal are detailed in Section [10.1.3.2](#page-111-1).

We can differentiate between permanently installed and mobile devices.

1 Permanently installed devices

For example, the stadiums used for the 2006 FIFA World Cup had permanently installed turnstiles that regulated access to the venues. Inspection units corresponding with [Figure 10â3](#page-118-1) were integrated into these turnstiles, and connected to the central access system via a LAN. If an entitlement is evaluated successfully, access is granted by unlocking the turnstile and turning it on.

<span id="page-118-0"></span>![](_page_118_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### **Figure 10â3 Reader and Smart Card or Smart Label**

<span id="page-118-1"></span>The turnstiles are situated around the perimeter of the stadium. While people are being let in, marshals are in the entrance areas to assist in the event of faults, and to notice any obvious attempts to manipulate the turnstiles.

The stationary inspection units should have features such as the following:

- a Contact-less read/write unit with interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443A/B Part 1- 4.
- b Capacity to store all usage data until the next data exchange with the central system.
- c Parallel support of multiple carrier media, applications and products (selection using ID).
- d Basic cryptographic functions.
- e Support for SAMs. Multiple SAM slots should be available (four is now the usual number).
- f The result of the validation should be displayed visually.

In the case of turnstiles, it should not take any longer than 300 ms for the evaluation process up to the point at which authorisation is signalled or the turnstile is unlocked. The reader and the other components involved must be designed to perform accordingly.

2 Mobile devices

Most venues do not have permanently installed access systems. In such cases the alternative is marshals equipped with mobile devices. These devices are connected to the central access system via a WLAN. The marshal grants access once the entitlement has been evaluated successfully and displayed accordingly.

The turnstiles are situated around the perimeter of the stadium. While people are being let in, marshals are in the entrance areas to assist in the event of faults, and to notice any obvious attempts to manipulate the turnstiles.

#### <span id="page-119-0"></span>**10.1.4.5 Service-Desk**

In real-life events, a certain amount of defective customer media, incorrect operations, attacks on security and fraud attempts is inevitable. The service desk at the venue is the point of contact if problems occur during entry.

Customers with valid entitlements must be able to access the event even if the access system or customer medium fails, or if he operates the system incorrectly. For this to happen it must be possible to perform Process P4, "Blacklisting entitlements and carrier media", and to issue a replacement medium, quickly and efficiently.

The following tasks are undertaken at the service desk:

1 Check the function of the carrier medium and the status of the entitlement.

If a fault occurs, then:

2 Check whether the medium is genuine and/or check the identity of the customer.

If positive, then:

- 3 Blacklist the medium and entitlement presented.
- 4 Issue a replacement medium with a new entitlement.
- 5 Update the information in the ticket system and the medium and application management systems.
- 6 Transfer the information from the ticket system to the access system.

The emergency scenarios in the event of the failure of the access system are based on the marshals and the service desk. Both are therefore of key importance to system security. If an attacker succeeds in causing a malfunction which overburdens the marshals and the service desk, it is equivalent to a successful DoS attack on the entire access system.

#### **10.1.4.6 Management system for carrier media and applications**

For the processes of loading applications and entitlements, and for the processes in which the customer medium is used for identification and for utilising transport services, it is important to know the status of the carrier medium and the applications on it.

For this reason, the life-cycle of any carrier medium used in the system must be documented reliably. To this end a database is used which is connected via interfaces to the ticket system and the key management system. It contains information such as the following for every carrier medium:

- ID of carrier medium
- Type, version
- Retailer of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- Issuer of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blacklisted)
- Stored applications (see below)
- etc.

Similarly, the life-cycle of the applications stored on the carrier medium must also be documented. Several different applications can be stored.

â¢ ID of application

- <span id="page-120-0"></span>â¢ Type, version
- Application provider (ID via registrar)
- Application issuer (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blacklisted/deleted)
- Stored entitlements including ID of product retailer
- Active entitlements / deletable entitlements

#### **10.1.4.7 Threats relevant to sale, inspection and management systems**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the assumptions used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-103-1)

**Table 10â9 Safeguards for sale, inspection and management systems** 

#### **10.1.4.9 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **10.1.5 Key management**

The job of the key management system is to provide keys used by multiple entities for all of the carrier media, applications and products in the system, and to do so securely and relia<span id="page-125-0"></span>bly. Key management is the responsibility of the security manager. A number of use cases are described in Section 7.3. [GSHB] can be used as a general guideline for implementation.

Keys are generated individually for each purpose. As far as possible, a distinct key is allocated to each form of interaction (e.g. loading applications, writing entitlements, reading entitlements, writing usage data, etc.). The precise characteristics have to be ascertained for each application scenario as part of the creation of a specific security concept that harmonises with the role model.

The keys are generated in a secure environment and stored in a secure database. The various forms of SAM are also produced in this secure environment. The documentation of the life-cycle of the SAMs that are produced and issued is another of the key management system's tasks.

The SAMs and keys are generated by the security manager as and when users need them. This can be the organiser or the initialiser or personaliser he appoints, or the service provider. The following types of SAM are basically supported:

| Initialiser SAMs      | Initialiser SAMs are required to initialise carrier media and load<br>applications.                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personaliser SAMs     | Personaliser SAMs are required to load entitlements in the ap<br>propriate applications.                                                                            |
| Service provider SAMs | Service provider SAMs are required by the service provider to<br>read and activate entitlements, and in some cases to send the<br>usage data to the carrier medium. |

Where required there may also be special SAMs that help transmit the product ID of the suppliers of carrier media, applications and products securely onto the carrier medium.

Key information is normally loaded onto a SAM when the user requires it. The aim of an initialiser is, for example, to enable all of the carrier media that occur in its area to be initialised with the necessary applications without changing the SAM.

This kind of user-specific SAM must be configured under an agreement between the user of the SAM and the system manager.

The SAM should support the secure loading of new keys via a network. Ideally, updating can be done by the security manager directly.

#### **10.1.5.1 Key management for service providers / SAMs for service providers**

Event-specific key information is required to evaluate entitlements. The reliability and security of the key management system involved in this is of critical importance to the overall concept. If the keys held by the service provider do not correspond with those in the carrier media and entitlements used for entry, then the evaluation of entitlements will not work. If keys are lost or made public, then the entire security concept will be discredited.

In this proposal, special SAMs are issued to the service provider as the operator of the inspection system. These service provider SAMs contain the key information relevant to the services offered, and must be integrated into the terminals.

When service provider SAMs are used, key management is restricted to the handing-over, handling and management of the SAMs. Since the keys are protected against unauthorised reading when using SAMs, the risk â and therefore the extent of the protection required â is limited. The use of standardised SAMs also reduces the expense of adapting to new applications and events.

#### **10.1.5.4 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

**Table 10â13 Categorisation of chip products** 

#### **10.2.1 Initialising carrier media and applications**

The initialisation of carrier media is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.2](#page-35-2)[,7.3,](#page-36-2) [7.9.2](#page-42-2). There are different ways of facilitating this:

- 1 Initialisation by a special service provider. This is used particularly in cases where large numbers of chip cards are issued.
- 2 Initialisation controlled from the ticket system, in vending machines or ticket printers.
- 3 Applications are loaded onto existing customer media under the management of the ticket system.

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the initialisation system.

#### **10.2.2 Personalising carrier media and applications**

Loading entitlements is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.4,](#page-37-2) [7.9.3](#page-43-2). There are different ways of facilitating this:

- 1 The entitlement is loaded by a special service provider during the initialisation process. This is used particularly in cases where large numbers of chip cards are issued.
- 2 Entitlement loading in vending machines or ticket printers, controlled from the ticket system.
- 3 Entitlements are loaded onto existing applications and customer media under the management of the ticket system.

<span id="page-131-0"></span>The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the personalisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the personalisation system.

### **10.2.3 Determining the protection demand for the carrier media**

The choice of protection demand category is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-133-1)

#### **10.2.4 Threats to the carrier medium**

The following table lists the threats to the carrier medium. The allocation of protection categories is highly dependent on the product being supported, and therefore on the application scenario concerned, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11](#page-133-1).

**Table 10â14 Threats relevant to the carrier medium** 

### **10.2.5 Definition of specific safeguards**

The allocation of safeguards is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-133-1)

# <span id="page-133-1"></span><span id="page-133-0"></span>**11 Suggestions on executing the product-specific application scenarios**

### **11.1 The "Non-personalised single entitlement" application scenario**

### **11.1.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "Non-personalised single entitlement with seat number" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 Low commercial value (â¬15 â¬100)
- 2 No personal data
- 3 No personal usage data
- 4 No personal calculation data
- 5 This entitlement is used once, and re-entry is not allowed.
- 6 This example does not consider the separation of fans or the exclusion of known violent offenders, which means that that security target is not relevant.

For reasons of economy, it is usually only the Smart Ticket which can be produced specially for this product and issued with an entitlement. In the case of all other carrier media, only the loading of the entitlement onto an existing customer medium is advisable, for reasons of cost. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-54-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

| Security target                                               |   | Protection<br>demand<br>category                                                                                                        | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                         |  |  |

#### **Table 11â3 Use cases relevant to the "Non-personalised single entitlement" application scenario**

The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases. The medium must demonstrate a protection category at least as high as that defined for each threat. Higher protection categories can be used if the carrier medium supports them.

#### <span id="page-138-0"></span>**11.1.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements of product type "Non-personalised single entitlement with seat number" are issued on carrier media of type "Smart Ticket". The carrier medium is initialised with an application which can contain one or more entitlements. The chip's security mechanisms are limited to the blocking of certain memory sectors and possibly simple access protection (see Section [10.2](#page-128-1)).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is done together with the personalisation of the entitlement in a mass personaliser, at the sales point or in a vending machine.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

In this application scenario, customer media are allowed that potentially may enable entitlements to be emulated (NFC Mobile Device). This means there is a need to protect against emulation of the "Smart Ticket".

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â2.](#page-137-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

| Table 11â4 | Safeguards when utilising Smart Tickets |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
|------------|-----------------------------------------|

#### **11.1.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.1.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "Secure chip card" carrier medium type is basically impossible to depict with this entitlement for reasons of cost. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Non-personalised single entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto a carrier medium of type "Secure chip card", which is already in the possession of the customer. It is assumed that a suitable application already exists on the carrier medium.

When using an existing "Secure chip card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement is loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

**Table 11â5 Safeguards for a "Non-personalised single entitlement" on a "Secure chip card" carrier medium** 

#### **11.1.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.1.3.5 Safeguards when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "Multi-application card" carrier medium type with this entitlement is impossible to depict for reasons of cost. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Non-personalised single entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "Multi-application card", which is already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded onto the card.

When using an existing "Multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

**Table 11â6 Safeguards when using the multi-application card** 

#### **11.1.3.6 Residual risks when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.1.3.7 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium type is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Non-personalised single entitlement with seat number" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "NFC Mobile Device", which is already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC Mobile Device.

When an existing "NFC Mobile Device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

<span id="page-144-0"></span>When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the closed-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

### **11.1.3.8 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

# **11.2 The "Personalised single entitlement" application scenario**

### **11.2.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "Personalised single entitlement with seat number" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

1 Low commercial value (â¬15 â â¬150)

- 2 Personal data on the carrier medium
- 3 Personal usage data
- 4 No personal calculation data
- 5 This entitlement is used once, but re-entry is allowed.
- 6 Violently inclined fans are to be expected.

For reasons of economy, it is usually only the Smart Ticket which can be produced specially for this product and issued with an entitlement. In the case of all other carrier media, only the loading of the entitlement onto an existing customer medium is advisable. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-54-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

| Security target |                                                        | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                                         |

**Table 11â10 Use cases relevant to the "Personalised single entitlement" application scenario** 

<span id="page-151-0"></span>The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases. The medium must demonstrate a protection category at least as high as that defined for each threat. Higher protection categories can be used if the carrier medium supports them.

#### **11.2.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements of product type "Personalised single entitlement with seat number" are issued on carrier media of type "Smart Ticket". The carrier medium is initialised with an application which can contain one or more entitlements. The chip's security mechanisms are limited to the blocking of certain memory sectors and possibly simple access protection (see Section [10.2](#page-128-1)).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is done together with the personalisation of the entitlement in a mass personaliser, at the sales point or in a vending machine.

The name of the event, the name of the customer, the block, seat and so on are printed onto the "Smart Ticket".

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

In this application scenario, customer media are allowed that potentially may enable entitlements to be emulated (NFC Mobile Device). This means there is a need to protect against emulation of the "Smart Ticket".

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â9.](#page-150-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â11 Safeguards when utilising the Smart Ticket**

#### **11.2.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.2.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "Secure chip card" carrier medium type is basically impossible to depict with this entitlement for reasons of cost. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Personalised single entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "Secure chip card", which are already in the possession of the customer. It is assumed that a suitable application already exists on the carrier medium.

When using an existing "Secure chip card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement is loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### **Table 11â12 Safeguards for a "Personalised single entitlement" on a "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

#### **11.2.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.2.3.5 Safeguards when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "Multi-application card" carrier medium type with this entitlement is impossible to depict for reasons of cost. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Personalised single entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "Multi-application card", which is already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded onto the card.

When using an existing "Multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â9.](#page-150-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â13 Safeguards when utilising multi-application cards**

#### **11.2.3.6 Residual risks when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.2.3.7 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium type is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Personalised single entitlement with seat number" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "NFC Mobile Device", which is already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC Mobile Device.

When an existing "NFC Mobile Device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the closed-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â9.](#page-150-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â14 Safeguards when utilising the NFC Mobile Device**

#### **11.2.3.8 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

### <span id="page-161-0"></span>**11.3 The "Personalised season entitlement" application scenario**

#### **11.3.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "Personalised season entitlement with seat number" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 Commercial value (â¬200 â¬500)
- 2 Personal data on the carrier medium
- 3 Personal usage data
- 4 Interoperability with other service providers is required (e.g. for use at away games) -> calculation data.
- 5 The entitlement is used repeatedly over a defined period of time. The card may also be carried around with the customer all of the time.
- 6 Re-entry must be enabled.
- 7 Violently inclined fans are to be expected.

The "Personalised season entitlement" product is normally issued on a "Secure chip card" or "Multi-application card" carrier medium, or loaded onto existing "Multi-application card" or "NFC Mobile Device" carrier media. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

If interoperability has to be assured technically between the service providers and product retailers, then the product is normally issued on the "Multi-application card" carrier medium. If not, then the "Secure chip card" is the carrier medium most often used in practice.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-54-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

#### **Table 11â17 Use cases relevant to the "Personalised season entitlement" application scenario**

The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases. The medium must demonstrate a protection category at least as high as that defined for each threat. Higher protection categories can be used if the carrier medium supports them.

#### **11.3.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements of product type "Personalised season entitlement" are normally issued on carrier media of type "secure chip card" or "multi-application card". The carrier medium is initialised with an application which can contain one or more entitlements. The chip's security mechanisms normally include authentication, access protection and secure transmission (see Section [10.2\)](#page-128-1).

When using an existing "Secure chip card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities, but they will have agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement is loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to counter the threats in [Table 11â16.](#page-165-1) The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â18 Safeguards for a "Personalised season entitlement" on a "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

#### **11.3.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "Secure chip card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.3.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "Multi-application card" carrier medium type with this entitlement is impossible to depict for reasons of cost. In this application scenario it is therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Personalised season entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "Multi-application card", which is already in the customers' possession. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded onto the card.

When using an existing "Multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

The entitlement is activated when the customer enters the event. If the customer leaves the closed-off area then that also requires the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â16.](#page-165-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â19 Safeguards when using the multi-application card**

#### **11.3.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "Multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.

#### **11.3.3.5 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium type is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Personalised season entitlement with seat number" will be loaded at a later stage onto an carrier medium of type "NFC Mobile Device", which is already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC Mobile Device.

When an existing "NFC Mobile Device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the closed-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â16.](#page-165-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-62-1)

#### **Table 11â20 Safeguards when utilising the NFC Mobile Device**

#### **11.3.3.6 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC Mobile Device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the implementation concerned.
