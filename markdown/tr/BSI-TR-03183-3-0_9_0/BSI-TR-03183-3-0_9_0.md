### <span id="page-4-0"></span>1 Introduction

Vulnerabilities have an impact on security and probably even safety of products, its users and the environment. However, they cannot be avoided when developing software and hardware. The more complex a system is and the more dependencies it includes, the more frequently vulnerabilities will occur. Moreover, hardly ever all vulnerabilities are discovered before a product is placed on the market, even after intensive testing. Therefore, a vulnerability handling process is necessary before and during the time for each product in use. As such, this process requires at least the creation, release, secure distribution and installation of updates or the implementation of other mitigation measures for affected products.

In scope of this Technical Guideline by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) are only vulnerabilities related to cybersecurity by causing a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation, or reliability of an impacted component or components upon exploitation. Moreover, this Technical Guideline assumes that the manufacturer operates a website.

Although secure development and operating processes minimise the number of vulnerabilities in products, they do not guarantee that there are no vulnerabilities at all. Establishing a responsible and efficient response process for vulnerability reports adhering to the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process is therefore of central importance and the first step in reducing the potential harm and risk caused by a vulnerability.

To enable successful CVD processes, manufacturers should react positively to incoming vulnerability reports and should not threaten with legal actions as long as no criminal intention is apparent (see BSI CVD guideline for security researchers<sup>1</sup> ). In addition, manufacturers should be prepared for CVD processes, which require holistic internal processes involving the relevant departments, the designation and publication of contact options, the establishment of communication channels and the actual response to vulnerability reports. Throughout the entire CVD process, manufacturers should communicate proactively with the reporting entity and strive to continuously optimise internal processes.

The members of the European Union Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) Network<sup>2</sup> are the central points of contact in the EU for preventive and reactive measures related to cybersecurity incidents in computer systems. In Germany, the designated CSIRT is the Computer Emergency Response Team for Germany's federal authorities (CERT-Bund)<sup>3</sup> . It is operated by the BSI as the federal cybersecurity authority and the single point of contact for cybersecurity within the federal administration. BSI aims at elevating the level of cybersecurity in administration, businesses and society. Hence, validated and verified vulnerabilities notified to CERT-Bund and thus to the BSI are ALWAYS shared with the manufacturers or product owners to eliminate or mitigate them<sup>4</sup> .

As every CVD process starts with vulnerability reporting, it is essential to publish the contact options and CVD policies for external communication. A dedicated web page for security information and a **security.txt**<sup>5</sup> in accordance with RFC 9116<sup>6</sup> on the manufacturer's website fulfils this purpose.

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>2 Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14<sup>7</sup> (RFC 2119<sup>8</sup> , RFC 8174<sup>9</sup> ) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### <span id="page-6-0"></span>3 Basics

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>3.1 Terms used

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>**3.1.1 Manufacturer**

The CRA defines 'manufacturer' as a natural or legal person who develops or manufactures products with digital elements or has products with digital elements designed, developed or manufactured, and markets them under its name or trademark, whether for payment, monetisation or free of charge.

As the CRA is a market access regulation, "Manufacturer" is interpreted as combining the roles of "vendor" and "creator".

"Vendor" (German: "Anbieter") describes the role of the entity that provides the product with digital elements. Alternatively, but not necessarily with a commercial background the terms "Supplier" (German: "Lieferant") is used.

"Creator" (German: "Ersteller") describes the role of the entity that authored or created the product with digital elements.

As this Technical Guideline specifies technical requirements, it uses a different terminology and interprets "Manufacturer" as a combination of the entity that produces tangible goods, such as devices, and the entity that creates or provides intangible goods, such as software and software components, usually described by the term "author". Therefore, this Technical Guideline does not mention the terms "Distributor" or "Importer", as the roles of these parties are unrelated to the technical requirements stated here. These technical requirements are independent of the role, which is fulfilling them.

#### <span id="page-6-3"></span>**3.1.2 Vulnerability**

In this Technical Guideline, a vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a product, (web) application or service that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source<sup>10</sup> .

#### <span id="page-6-4"></span>**3.1.3 Valid, validated and verified vulnerability**

Every entity can decide, what it considers to be a valid vulnerability. These may include requirements from the reporting entity of the vulnerability. Recommendations concerning them are found in sectio[n 4.3.5](#page-14-1) and in the BSI CVD guideline for security researchers<sup>11</sup> .

After the manufacturer has confirmed that the vulnerability complies with its rules for a valid vulnerability, this vulnerability is a validated vulnerability.

After the manufacturer has assessed a validated vulnerability with regard to its severity and exploitability, this vulnerability is a validated and verified vulnerability.

#### <span id="page-6-5"></span>**3.1.4 Vulnerability notification**

In this Technical Guideline, a vulnerability notification is a general information about a vulnerability, which usually names the product concerned and contains an initial assessment with a tentative CVSS Base Score but no deeper details of the vulnerability. Commonly, the notifications are sent by the manufacturer to CSIRTs or ENISA and are non-public.

<sup>10</sup> <https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability>

<sup>11</sup> [https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/IT-Schwachstellen/it-schwachstellen\\_node.html](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/IT-Schwachstellen/it-schwachstellen_node.html)

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**3.1.5 Security advisory**

In this Technical Guideline, a security advisory is also an information about a vulnerability, which usually contains the information of the vulnerability notification including a reviewed CVSS Base Score and more details with the focus of remediation and mitigation of the vulnerability. Commonly, the advisories are sent by the manufacturer to all users of the product and are publicly disclosed. Their recommended distribution is the publication on the manufacture's website applying Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) documents<sup>12</sup> .

#### <span id="page-7-1"></span>**3.1.6 Vulnerability Report**

In this Technical Guideline, a vulnerability report is an information about a vulnerability, which usually contains the information of the vulnerability notification and more details with the focus of identification, exploitation and reproduction, e.g. with a proof-of-concept (POC), of the vulnerability. Commonly, the reports are sent by security researchers or CSIRTs to the manufacturer of the product and are confidential.

#### <span id="page-7-2"></span>**3.1.7 Corresponding CSIRT**

To comply with this Technical Guideline, manufacturers MUST choose any of the CSIRTs of the European Union CSIRTs network for vulnerability notifications as its corresponding CSIRT. The corresponding CSIRT MUST be determined according to Article 14 (7) CRA. Moreover, manufacturers MUST stay at their corresponding CSIRT during the active handling of every single valid vulnerability except the corresponding CSIRT transfers the handling. Furthermore, manufactures SHOULD choose the same CSIRT as corresponding one for the communication about each and every vulnerability.

#### <span id="page-7-3"></span>**3.1.8 Anonymous reporting option**

In this Technical Guideline, an anonymous reporting option provides a contact option with the manufacturer where the reporting entity can stay anonymous. This SHOULD be a web form on the manufacturer's website. This web form MUST NOT contain any third party components, e.g. advertisements or tracking pixel. While entering data and using this web form, the logging of metadata MUST be minimized. Therefore, the information that MUST NOT be logged includes the IP address, the browser or the computer of reporting entity.

### <span id="page-8-0"></span>4 Cybersecurity requirements for receiving vulnerability reports

In order to establish a process for receiving vulnerability reports that is compliant with this Technical Guideline, at least the following requirements MUST be fulfilled. The implemented measures to fulfil these requirements, all test procedures and all test results MUST be recorded. For clarification, the requirements in this section are considered as minimal requirements for receiving vulnerability reports. Hence, further statements e.g. in the **security.txt** (see section [4.1\)](#page-8-1), on the web page for incoming vulnerability reports (see section [4.4\)](#page-16-1) or in the CVD policy (see section [4.3\)](#page-13-1) and additional preliminary measures for a CVD process (see section [4.2\)](#page-11-0) are allowed.

#### <span id="page-8-1"></span>4.1 Security.txt file in accordance with RFC 9116

To make it easier for the reporting entity to find the right contact for vulnerability reports, a **security.txt** in accordance with RFC 9116 MUST be created and made available on the manufacturer's website. The security requirements for the **security.txt** are based on the recommendations formulated in the BSI's cybersecurity recommendation "Sicherheitskontakte mit Hilfe einer security.txt nach RFC 9116 angeben"<sup>13</sup> and the RFC 9116 itself. A recommended **security.txt** is shown as an example in [Figure 1.](#page-11-2)

#### <span id="page-8-2"></span>**4.1.1 Localisation of security.txt**

- a. The manufacturer MUST create a file with the name **security.txt** in the path /.well-known/ (e.g. **/.well-known/security.txt**).
- b. This file MUST be accessible via HTTPS using at least HTTP 1.1 according to RFC 7230<sup>14</sup> or a higher version.
- c. This file MUST be a plain text file with ASCII or UTF-8 encoding, whereby only the ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x7E MUST be used for non-comments.
- d. The manufacturer MUST comply with the respective format specifications of RFC 9116 for all information in this file.

#### <span id="page-8-3"></span>**4.1.2 Contact information**

- a. The manufacturer SHOULD introduce the list of contact options for reporting vulnerabilities with the comment **# Our security addresses**.
- b. The declaration of the first contact option MUST be the email address of the functional mailbox of manufacturer's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) in accordance with RFC 6068<sup>15</sup> (see sectio[n4.2.1\)](#page-11-1).
- c. The declaration of the first contact option MUST be the email address of the functional mailbox of the manufacturer's CSIRT in accordance with RFC 6068 (see sectio[n4.2.1\)](#page-11-1).
- d. The next point of contact MUST be the URL of the manufacturer's web page for incoming vulnerability reports (see section [4.4\)](#page-16-1) according to RFC 7230 and RFC 3986<sup>16</sup> .

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>**4.1.3 Expiry date**

- a. The manufacturer MUST specify the expiry date of the **security.txt** according to RFC 3339<sup>17</sup> . The separator "T" MUST be upper cases – other separators MUST NOT be used. The time zone indicator "Z" MUST be upper case as well, if applicable.
- b. This value SHOULD be at the maximum of one year in the future.

- e. The first cybersecurity contact MUST be the manufacturer's PSIRT, which covers the vulnerability handling of the manufacturer's products.
- f. The email address of the PSIRT functional mailbox MUST clearly indicate its function. Therefore, the local part of the email (email prefix) MUST be "psirt", e.g. [psirt@example.com](mailto:psirt@example.com). Moreover, additional mailboxes with at least "productcert" and "vulnerability" as local part of the email MUST be created. Incoming emails to these additional mailboxes MUST be redirected to the PSIRT functional mailbox.
- g. The second cybersecurity contact MUST be the manufacturer's CSIRT, which covers the vulnerability handling of the manufacturer's infrastructure.
- h. The email address of the CSIRT functional mailbox MUST clearly indicate its function. Therefore, the local part of the email (email prefix) MUST be "csirt", e.g. [csirt@example.com](mailto:csirt@example.com). Moreover, additional mailboxes with at least "cert" and "security" as local part of the email MUST be created. Incoming emails to these additional mailboxes MUST be redirected to the PSIRT functional mailbox.
- i. The manufacturer MUST publish the email addresses of the functional mailboxes at the "Contact Us" web page of its website, if this web page exists.
- j. The manufacturer MUST use dedicated OpenPGP sub-keys (of the same OpenPGP "identity key") according to RFC 4880<sup>24</sup> for the email addresses of the functional mailboxes in accordance with the specifications of the current TR-03116 Part 4 or the current SOG-IS Crypto Evaluation Scheme Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms and offer encrypted and signed communication with these subkeys.
- k. The manufacturer MAY provide additional security options for the email addresses of the functional mailboxes in accordance with the specifications of the current TR-03116 Part 4 or the current SOG-IS Crypto Evaluation Scheme Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms and offer encrypted and signed communication with these keys, e.g. S/MIME or OpenPGP according to RFC 6637<sup>25</sup> .

### <span id="page-13-1"></span>4.3 CVD policy

The CVD policy is intended to help, improve, standardise and speed up the entire CVD process. It defines the handling of vulnerability reports. This includes the manufacturer's assurance to the reporting entity, how the report will be handled and what is required for a successful CVD process. Therefore, the manufacturer's CVD policy MUST have at least the following characteristics. The requirements of the CVD policy base inter alia on the "BSI CVD guideline for security researchers26", Guidelines on implementing national Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policies<sup>27</sup> and the ETSI TR 103 838 V1.1.1<sup>28</sup> .

Providing incentives can encourage the willingness to report vulnerabilities in manufacturers' products. Offering a "Hall of Fame" web page is one way for manufacturers to publicly thank reporting entities for their vulnerability reports. By establishing financial rewards (bug bounty programme) for those who find vulnerabilities, manufacturers can express their appreciation and create a positive incentive structure. This Technical Guideline considers reward programmes as an OPTIONAL element of a CVD policy.

- f. The manufacturer MUST ensure that, if requested by the reporting entity, the name/alias and a desired reference of the reporting entity will be published on the manufacturer's acknowledgement web page (Hall of Fame) after reporting a valid vulnerability and completion of the CVD process. In doing so, it SHOULD be clearly emphasised that all involved entities treat each other with respect and that there is no room for in the EU unlawful behaviour, like discrimination, sexism, racism, Nazism, glorification of violence, pornography, insults, defamation and slander. In the event of an offence in this regard, the institution MUST refrain from publication.
- g. The manufacturer MUST NOT require the reporting entity to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
- h. The manufacturer MUST recommend the reporting entity to use an encrypted and digitally signed email for the transmission of confidential information.
