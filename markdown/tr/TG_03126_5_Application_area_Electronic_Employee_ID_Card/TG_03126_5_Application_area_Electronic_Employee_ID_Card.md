# <span id="page-10-0"></span>**1 Introduction**

## **1.1 Motivation of the Technical Guideline RFID**

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has become a key technology in different kinds of applications areas. Due to the fact that it is used in the context of authentication or in combination with personal related data the applied security level is of major concern.

The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published technical guidelines describing generic security considerations regarding RFID in the following referenced to as TR RFID respectively TR 03126. The document in hand represents the fifth part of the technical guideline TR RFID whereas the following application areas have been examined:

- **-** TR 03126-1: Application area "eTicketing in public transport"
- **-** TR 03126-2: Application area "Event-Ticketing"
- **-** TR 03126-3: Application area "NFC-based eTicketing"
- **-** TR 03126-4: Application area "trade logistics"
- **-** TR 03126-5: Application area "Electronic Employee ID Card"

By describing the application area in terms of the system architecture, methodology, security requirements, and risks it is important to take care of a balanced cost-benefit ratio.

## **1.2 Structure and Approach of TR RFID**

In the following, the structure and approach how to read this guideline are introduced. Detailed information in particular how to apply this guideline can be found in section [5.](#page-27-0)

In section [2](#page-13-0) an overview of the initial situation and the system architecture is presented. Here, in particular the different components, services (i.e. applications), products, carrier media and the multilayered backend system are introduced. This includes also system components that are itself not equipped with RFID technology but are necessary for the operation of the overall system.

Further, in section [3,](#page-18-0) a presentation of the terminology is presented in connection with the generic description of the roles, entities, and connected relationships. Whereas this model supports a scalable and expandable approach.

A general consideration of requirements (compare section [4\)](#page-25-0) is followed by the methodology for determining the security requirements in section [5.](#page-27-0) This allows the system to be extended by a security architecture.

The application area "Electronic Employee ID Card" builds the base for the document in hand and therefore the generic business processes are analysed in more detail (compare section [6\)](#page-35-0) and the most important use cases are presented in section [7.](#page-47-0)

The security consideration represents the core element of this technical guideline and is accomplished in section [8.](#page-64-0) Thereby, the specific security targets of the main target groups are identified at first. Afterwards threats and safeguards are described. A realisation is achieved by individual security evaluations that are based on RFID relevant applications. For every individual realisation of a system, the protection demand category have to be defined for every security target. Thereby, the scope of the respective safeguards is returned.

Based on the described generic business processes (compare section [6\)](#page-35-0) and use cases (compare section [7\)](#page-47-0) an exemplary examination of the realisation of product specific application scenarios can be performed in section [9.](#page-141-0)

Finally, recommendations for the implementation of an overall system (compare section [10\)](#page-146-0) and the product specific application scenarios (compare section [11\)](#page-175-0) are presented.

## **1.3 Description of the application area for "Electronic Employee ID Card"**

The use of authentication is widespread in companies and authorities. The membership to an organisation and the access to the related applications and data can be realised in different ways e.g. by the use of identification cards, security tokens, transponders or by the presentation of a biometric feature. In the following, the application of identification cards is considered in more detail.

An important part of an identification card is the visual inspection. Therefore, different visual features e.g. a photo, information regarding the holder, colour codes and further additional information can be applied on the surface area of the card. While the application of those cards was limited to visual inspection at the beginning the introduction of electronic data has found its way into Electronic Employee ID Cards long ago. As a consequence, different kinds of application scenarios have emerged and have been taken into account in order to optimise and support the processes within organisations.

In general, an organisation can choose between the technologies of contact cards and contactless cards. Contact cards – as their name already implies - need to be inserted in a card reader device whereas contactless cards need to be bypassed in a specified distance to a card reader device respectively an electronic terminal. The use of contactless cards within companies can be advantageous in particular, when it comes to time critical use cases and by considerations of usability.

Nowadays, electronic identity documents are increasingly equipped with a contactless chip based on the standard ISO/IEC 14443. In Germany, the electronic Passport (ePassport) has been issued since 2005 and will be followed by the electronic identity card ("elektronischer Personalausweis") and electronic residence permit ("elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel"). Therefore the use of identity documents containing RFID technology is increasing substantially.

Due to the fact that applications of an electronic Employee ID Card are connected to different kinds of entitlements and personal data the security of the stored data is of major concern. In general, a system solution is designed based on the individual requirements of an organisation. Therefore, the costs can vary quiet heavily.

This is to be the basis for the following considerations.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>**2 Description of system components**

The introduction and usage of an electronic Employee ID Card depends heavily on the initial situation as well as the objectives of the according organisation. Although organisations differ in their requirements and preconditions a description of the system architecture can always be characterised based on the components used such as hardware resources, software and applications, networks (e.g. subnetworks and locations), communication relationships as well as roles (compare section [3.2\)](#page-20-0) and processes (compare section [6\)](#page-35-0).

## <span id="page-13-2"></span>**2.1 System architecture**

[Figure 1](#page-13-1) gives a generic overview regarding the main components that have to be considered by issuing and operating an electronic Employee ID Card.

![](_page_13_Figure_5.jpeg)

<span id="page-13-1"></span>*Figure 1: System components*

At first glance three main system components can be abstracted:

**-** The *carrier medium* equipped *with a contactless interface* is provided as basis for the electronic Employee ID Card. It can enclose card applications, application parameters, and entitlements. Normally, a specific carrier medium is issued by an organisation or if compatible to the

requirements of an organisation a governmental eID document is applied that can be used for eBusiness (i.e. an eID application that supports security mechanisms such as [\[EAC10\]](#page-244-1) or comparable).

- **-** The *RF-Terminal[1](#page-14-0)* works as the interface between the management system that administers all applications, relevant data and functions and the carrier medium that encloses the card applications and entitlements of the employee on the other side.
- **-** The *management system* which encapsulates two main subcomponents.
	- **-** The *application part* is used by the organisation to manage all relevant services that are offered within that organisation. This includes software for the personalisation of new electronic Employee ID Cards[2](#page-14-1) and services that have been established based on the technical, organisational, legal and other requirements. Different levels of entitlements are provided for these software applications. In this technical guideline in particular the following software applications are considered in more detail:
		- **-** Access Control whereas physical access to a building, subsequent divisions and/or even individual rooms in an organisation can be comprised.
		- **-** Time Registration that logs e.g. the working hours, availability, overtime of an employee.
		- **-** Payment of additional services such as cafeterias, kiosks, parking lots, or further cashless applications.
		- **-** Access to IT systems as extension to the physical access modern business processes require access to electronic applications, functions, and data.
	- **-** The administration of all relevant data and functions is combined within the *backend system*. In many cases the backend system is offered by one provider but an organisation can also decide to use services from different service providers at one time. In the second case it can be advantages to store specific data on the carrier medium to enable the use of the document between applications. A closer view on the backend system unveils the following main subparts that are usually enclosed:
		- **-** Life Cycle Management System this component provides all necessary functions that are necessary to personalise, configure, and change the carrier medium with the contactless interface.
		- **-** Key Management encloses all relevant security parameters and cryptographic keys that are needed to provide a specific security level.

<span id="page-14-0"></span><sup>1</sup> If the electronic Employee ID Card is used with biometric authentication e.g. via fingerprint matching the RF-Terminal is equipped with an additional biometric unit.

<span id="page-14-1"></span><sup>2</sup> And software for the enrolment of biometric data if the electronic Employee ID Card is used e.g. with fingerprint recognition.

**-** Whitelists and blacklists

enclose information regarding the activation or deactivation of entitlements. If offline systems are supported the lists have to be transferred to the respective terminals. Nevertheless of the applied system, those lists are used to administer blocking information of the system.

**-** The Central Management Information System provides all central functions to allow the operating of the different applications and controls the interaction of all relevant system components. Thus, the general operation of the overall system is ensured.

Depending on the requirements of an organisation i.e. which of the afore described application scenarios are realised the product exhibits different kinds of characteristics and arrangements. Therefore, all of the afore described applications can be applied or only selected applications can be implemented. Differences can appear for example in the following areas:

**-** Individual-related personalisation

Product provider can realise different methods for the personalisation of identity cards. A carrier medium can be assigned to a specific person or a group that is connected to a specific set of entitlements.

- **-** Storage of an entitlement matrix on the carrier medium or the corresponding management system.
- **-** Shadow account or stored payment value on the carrier medium.
- **-** Storage of cryptographic keys, mechanisms and parameters.

A carrier media is often used for authentication which can be realised as *ownership* together with or without *knowledge* or *inherence.* The following alternatives are available:

- **-** ID card with contactless interface
- **-** Contact ID card[3](#page-15-0)
- **-** Secure token[4](#page-15-1)
- **-** Biometrics in combination with an electronic Employee ID Card (i.e. biometrics stored on card[5](#page-15-2) or biometrics stored in a reference data base)
- **-** Biometrics without the use of an ID card[6](#page-15-3)

For the use of biometrics for authentication in combination with an electronic Employee ID Card different options exist. Biometrics features can be stored either on the card or in a reference data base. Detailed information regarding the different biometric verification methods can be found in [\[TT06\]](#page-244-5) and [\[BIOP2\].](#page-244-4) In any case the work council or a comparable instance and the data protection official of the respective organisation shall be involved in the complete process from the very beginning. Thereby, comprehensive information can be obtained in [\[TT08\]](#page-244-3) and [\[TT05\].](#page-244-2)

<span id="page-15-0"></span><sup>3</sup> This alternative is not considered any further within this technical guideline.

<span id="page-15-1"></span><sup>4</sup> This alternative is not considered any further within this technical guideline.

<span id="page-15-2"></span><sup>5</sup> The storage on the card offers the advantage that the biometric data is in the possession of the owner.

<span id="page-15-3"></span><sup>6</sup> For biometric authentication a reference database can be used. In this technical guideline the storage on the card is mainly considered.

If biometric features are stored on the carrier medium the verification can either be performed on the card i.e. match-on-card or within the terminal, whereas the first case is recommended. If a reference data base is used the verification is performed within the management system.

## **2.2 Considerations and limitation of this Technical Guideline**

In this guideline an electronic Employee ID Card is considered that supports secure usage of RFID based systems. Thereby, the following precondition and limitations of the system shall be considered:

- 1. Visual characteristics are still an important part of an identity document and represent one important application. Often, a facial image is printed on the document which is taken during application or provided by the employee. Nevertheless, physical characteristics are not of main interest in this guideline and will therefore only be considered marginally.
- 2. Other authentication methods such as secure tokens or other technologies e.g. contact smart cards, hybrid cards or dual interface cards are not part of this document and are therefore not considered. The decision to exclude dual interface cards does not mean that the use of these cards is not recommended. In any case additional security targets might be considered.
- 3. Access control can be realised by online and offline systems. While online systems have a direct and immediate connection to the management system, offline or semi-offline scenarios are not directly connected - i.e. a terminal is not connected or only temporarily connected online to a central management system. Although offline systems may be necessary in some cases e.g. due to local conditions such as missing connection possibilities or only less users they can have negative consequences regarding flexibility, simplicity, and security of applications. In this case the actuality of the management of the entitlements has to be realised over the offline or semioffline terminals by using whitelists or blacklists. In particular, blocking of entitlements can be accompanied with delay. In this technical guideline in the first place online scenarios are considered whereas offline scenarios are taken into account if the security level is affected.
- 4. The application scenarios and use cases that are considered in the following are connected with personal information of the employee. For this reason, privacy is very important and must be comprised in every consideration. Further information can be obtained in [\[BK07\].](#page-245-0)
- 5. Payment systems can be open or closed (compare [\[FI08\]\)](#page-244-6). A closed system can be used within the scope of one service provider. In this case the amount of money is usually stored as a value on the carrier medium. Open systems are based on international standards and allow to be applied between different application providers. Hereby, the accounting is realised based on a (shadow) account.
- 6. If an eID document is applied as electronic Employee ID Card only the eID application and if applicable the eSign application are considered. The biometric data stored on the document cannot be used.
- 7. With single-application-cards, including only one application, and multi-application-cards including several applications different products exist. Due to the fact that organisations apply electronic Employee ID Cards in different application scenarios this technical guideline is focused on multi-application-cards.

#### 2 Description of system components

8. In general, besides the technical safeguards described in the following there exist organisational safeguards that may counteract the respective threats in an adequate way. Nevertheless, these organisational safeguards are not described any further within this technical guideline.

## **3.1 Definition of terms**

| Application          | The electronic Employee ID Card distinguishes different kinds of<br>applications. The carrier medium with the contactless interface<br>encloses applications which represent a defined sector (e.g. file<br>structure on the card) that can be secured by access control. The<br>application itself contains e.g. application parameters and entitlements<br>or further additional information. In the following applications stored<br>on an electronic Employee ID Card are referred to as card<br>applications. |  |  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
|                      | Electronic Employee ID Cards communicate with applications of the<br>organisation which itself are part of the management system. These<br>are called software applications. Due to the fact that the memory of<br>the management system is not subject to restriction as it is the case<br>with identity cards the software applications can be quite large.                                                                                                                                                      |  |  |
| Application area     | The area in which the technical guidelines are intended to be applied.<br>Reflects the highest unit in the terminological structure. Incorporates<br>one or more applications, the products/services that belong to those<br>applications, and the resulting application objectives that result from<br>the application scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |
| Application scenario | A particular way of looking at the application area in terms of the<br>implementation of specific products and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |  |
| Authentication data  | Authentication can be performed based on unique identifiers,<br>cryptographic keys and/or cryptographic functions and parameters. If<br>biometrics are used to verify a person the biometric feature e.g. in<br>form of a template can be securely stored on the identity card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |
| Employee data        | The employee data characterises the personal data that is necessary to<br>establish an electronic identity for a specific employee or to<br>accomplish the entitlements for that employee. The master data is<br>administered by human resources and stored mainly in the<br>management system. Due to the restrictions of the carrier medium<br>selected personal data can also be stored within the identity card e.g.<br>biometric data of the employee.                                                        |  |  |
| Interoperability     | Interoperability means that the issuer of electronic Employee ID Cards<br>can rely on applications, carrier media, card reader devices (i.e.<br>terminals), and further components and services that are based on<br>international established standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |  |

As an example this can be a matrix<br>enclosing entitlements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Use case     | Detailed description of a series of activities that constitute part of an<br>operating process. Examples include initialising a carrier medium and<br>loading an entitlement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Terminal     | A terminal describes the reader device with which the electronic<br>Employee ID Card is read. Within the scope of EAC [EAC10]<br>different types of terminals are divided. An inspection system is used<br>by an official for governmental applications, while an authentication<br>terminal can be operated by an official but also by private sector<br>organisations. Furthermore a signature terminal has to fulfil specific<br>security requirements in order to provide the respective environment<br>for signature generation. |

The access and<br>execution of an application is managed by entitlements. Usually the<br>application is executed in the backend system i.e. management<br>system. The connection to the management system is established<br>over defined interfaces. In some cases application parameters are<br>loaded onto the carrier medium. If applications on the electronic<br>Employee ID Card are referenced the term card application is used. |
| Carrier medium                                        | The electronic Employee ID Card is the medium which is issued to<br>internal and external employees in order to assign entitlements and<br>load and store application parameters.

Other common names<br>used in this document for the carrier medium are electronic<br>Employee ID Card, user card, electronic identity card, or<br>contactless (smart) card.                                           |

Management System The management is the central system of the organisation with which all applications are administered (compare section [2.1\)](#page-13-2).

For the analysis of security targets (compare section [8.2\)](#page-66-0) the technical guideline has identified three main roles which will be considered in the following sections:

- **-** Product Provider
- **-** Organisation
- **-** Employee.

## **3.3 Relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements**

The model described in section [3.2](#page-20-0) allows an organisation to choose from different product providers and allows numerous application issuers to be involved.

As a consequence, different carrier media, applications and products (further hardware and software components) are available and can be combined, from which a company or an agency can choose in order to meet the organisational, technical, and legal requirements. In particular the requirements of the individual system architecture of the company have a great impact on the realisation concept. Furthermore (as described later in this guideline) security aspects have to be considered.

For the authorisation of an employee in one of the according application scenarios entitlements are assigned to a carrier medium - the electronic Employee ID Card. Thus, the associated services that are offered in the organisation can be used. An entitlement can be provided either to optimise processes in an organisation or to define a granular right management.

Applications provide the structures and functions required to load, use, block, unblock and withdraw entitlements within the scope of a carrier medium. Since requirements in an organisation can change the introduction of new applications shall be considered from the very beginning and the technical preconditions shall be provided if possible.

The following rules apply to the relationships between carrier media, applications, and entitlements:

![](_page_24_Figure_7.jpeg)

*Figure 3: Carrier media, applications, and entitlements*

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**4 General requirements**

In the following subsections special attention is drawn to the product specific usage of Electronic Employee ID Cards regarding security requirements. These requirements concerning the overall system, the connected processes and components can be divided into three categories:

- **-** Range of functionalities
- **-** Economics
- **-** Security.

## **4.1 Range of functionalities**

This section provides examples regarding the requirements of the target audience.

### **4.1.1 Employee requirements**

From the view of the holder of an Electronic Employee ID Card the following examples of requirements shall be fulfilled:

- **-** The carrier medium shall grant access based on assigned entitlements to activated applications.
- **-** The carrier medium shall be robust, reliable, and shall perform at the required speed.
- **-** The system and the carrier medium must be easy to use and comfortable e.g. processes can be optimised and if possible accelerated.
- **-** Reasonable protection of individual related personal data must be provided.
- **-** Support for the application of the electronic Employee ID Card must be provided e.g. by provision of a website of the organisation.
- **-** A help desk shall be available in case of problems such as temporary or irrecoverable lost of the carrier medium. If the carrier medium is not operational a replacement or fallback method shall be provided.
- **-** Reliable accounting in case of payment applications.
- **-** Convenient fallback mechanisms shall be available

Whenever contactless chip technology is used, the holder shall always be kept properly informed of the individual related data used, how it is employed, what is done to protect the data, and any risks that remain. The handling of personal data must be in accordance with the data protection official of the organisation and if applicable the work council or a comparable instance.

### **4.1.2 Requirements of the organisation and product provider**

At the same time the requirements of the organisation and the product provider shall be fulfilled.

### Functionality

- **-** Access to an organisation's applications must only be allowed to members that are equipped with an Electronic Employee ID Card.
- **-** Precise definition of access control, entitlements and further applications must be possible.
- **-** It must be easy to explain to the employees how the carrier medium, applications and systems are used.
- **-** Optimisation of business processes and thereby achieving of required speed of applications shall be possible.
- **-** The requirements of the organisation infrastructure shall be considered
	- **-** Individual system architecture with different computer systems (i.e. terminals, notebooks, server, etc.) and software components (e.g. operating systems)
	- **-** Integration of different, remote and/or distributed networks
- **-** It must be possible to suspend carrier media and according entitlements temporarily and completely and to issue replacements. Furthermore a reset of a carrier medium that has been blocked needs to be available.

Technical compatibility

- **-** The structure of the carrier medium and the applications shall be designed in a way that further adjustments and enhancements are possible. By this means new services can be integrated in an organisation with already established identification system. In particular flexibility, reusability, and protection of investment can be ensured.
- **-** Interoperability must be assured so that components of the system architecture can be exchanged. I.e. a reading device has to support established communication standards.

## **4.2 Economics**

For an economic operation of the system the commercial benefit for every stage of expansion must be greater than the cost of the processes, systems, and security. This must apply for all of the entities that invest in the installation of the system.

As a consequence, the overall system and the connected components need to be designed in a way that the requirements from all relevant application scenarios are fulfilled efficiently. Furthermore the security architecture shall be designed in a way that investment protection is established. Therefore, the requirements need to be specified as accurately as possible from the very beginning.

## **4.3 Security**

It is the main objective of this technical guideline to allow its users to enhance the individual system architecture by adequate security mechanisms to an according security architecture. Therefore, the individual requirements have to be retrieved and the needed protection demand has to be identified. This document will deal with the requirements of security separately, in particular in section [8](#page-64-0) and following.

# <span id="page-27-0"></span>**5 Methodology of determining security requirements**

## **5.1 Objectives**

Within the scope of the Technical Guidelines on secure use of RFID the following objectives are identified:

- **-** Provision of a guidance for system suppliers, operators and/or system users for an appropriate implementation of application specific system solutions regarding information security, safety, and data privacy
- **-** Establishment of awareness and transparency regarding security aspects.
- **-** Provision of a base for system supplier's (i.e. product providers) or operator's declaration of conformity, and for the issuing of quality seals by certification authorities (certificate).
- **-** By describing selected security requirements and defining delimited degrees of freedom products can be compared to each other. Furthermore less complex conformity tests can be specified. As a result higher quality connected with less costs can be achieved.

The following information is required in order to achieve the afore listed objectives:

- **-** A definition of the security requirements that must be fulfilled by a RFID system for a given application area.
- **-** A description of the specific risks, appropriate counter-measures, and potential remaining risks, in following called residual risks.
- **-** A definition of the criteria for declaration of conformity and for certification.

Only by considering all requirements - as specified in section [4](#page-25-0) and the afterwards identified security aspects - a definition of the relevant procedures and proposed systems can be conducted.

## **5.2 Methodology**

### **5.2.1 Scope of system considerations**

RFID-based systems can be very complex. In most cases, a lot of IT components that have no direct relation to RFID are part of the system solution. But at the same time the system security must not only be considered in terms of the carrier medium and the reading devices.

A Technical Guideline on secure use of RFID has to take all relevant technical security aspects into account in detail. These aspects depend heavily on the application area and the respective individual implementation of the system solution. As a consequence, the technical guideline in hand provides detailed information for the according application area and the respective operation processes (including for example the processes for initialisation and implementation of the system). The processes cover the complete life cycle of the carrier medium. Based on these processes use cases are specified that are relevant from the security point of view from the RFID system. The use cases serve as fundamentals for the identification of threats and a detailed, system specific security

evaluation for the area of the system that are used within the scope of RFID. Figure [4](#page-28-0) shows this approach for the example of application electronic Employee ID Card.

![](_page_28_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-28-0"></span>*Figure 4: Example: Identification of RFID-relevant use cases for the electronic Employee ID Card*

All other system components are only considered in general. The proposed safeguards are based on open IT security standards.

This concept focuses on the RFID relevant system parts, nevertheless all security aspects are taken into account. Furthermore the technical guideline allows individual and organisation specific IT implementations (specific architectures and infrastructures, applications, etc.) In particular, this approach allows enhancements of existing systems by using RFID technology.

### **5.2.2 Scalability and flexibility**

The technical guidelines address security issues in the first place. At the same time, any system implementation that follows this guideline must be economically viable. As a consequence, the following requirements regarding the methodology shall be considered:

1. It must be possible to implement systems in a way that the costs and benefits are balanced. In practice, this means that safeguards must be proportional to the need for protection i.e. they need to fulfil the protection demands but it is not necessary to exceed them. For example: If only lowcost products are used, that require only a low level of security , the protection demands shall be designed accordingly. This may allow to use low-cost media in order to reduce the costs for the implementation and further handling receptively handling of the system.

- 2. The application scenarios that have been chosen for the technical guideline cover a wide range, from small to nationwide and even international (cross-border) systems. It is important that the concept discussed in the guidelines can be used for system solutions of any size and complexity.
- 3. In many cases a system solution can be made economically viable much more easily if a cooperation with other companies or subunits is possible. This applies in particular to organisation that apply an electronic Employee ID Card, where it can be very beneficial if media are already available to employees (such as multi-application cards). These can be used for additional applications, products and related services e.g. an access card can be used for the cashless payment in cafeteria within this organisation. Nevertheless, in most cases one backend solution is applied.

Figure [5](#page-29-0) gives an example of a carrier medium for the electronic Employee ID Card that supports applications from different areas of use.

![](_page_29_Figure_5.jpeg)

<span id="page-29-0"></span>*Figure 5: Hierarchical concept for media, applications, and entitlements for electronic Employee ID Cards*

In order to realise the afore described requirements this technical guideline is based on the following concept:

1. An adequate role model (compare section [3\)](#page-18-0) and the structure of several key components (carrier medium, terminal, and management system) have been described in section [2.](#page-13-0) This model supports a scalable and extendible approach.

- 2. The technical guideline has to offer security concepts that enclose all combinations of application scenarios and media that are used in one infrastructure. This is achieved because of individual security evaluations that take RFID relevant applications into account.
- 3. Similar application scenarios (in particular electronic Employee ID Cards) that offer the possibility for cross-application partnerships are addressed by the respective technical guideline with as much communality as possible. The security evaluation takes similar security targets into account.
- 4. A special challenge exists within the scope of system security that has to be considered when it comes to system or cross-application partnerships. In this case it has to be ensured that the security of one system is not affected by leakages coming from another system[7](#page-30-0) . In general, a comprehensive security evaluation of both systems has to be performed.

The technical guidelines address this by introducing a scalable and transparent concept for applying safeguards against the identified threats, called "protection demand categories". A total of three categories are used starting by 1 (standard requirement) until 3 (high requirement). All safeguards are defined according to three levels starting by standard procedures until extended procedures.

For every individual system implementation the protection demand category has to be defined for every security target. As a result the respective safeguards are identified.

This concept provides an easy way to establish secure system cooperation. In the following it remains to ensure that the protection demand categories of both systems match together.

### **5.2.3 Explanation of the security concept**

Every technical guideline belonging to the TR RFID family contains examples of how security considerations shall be applied to specific application scenarios. These can be adapted to the requirements and peripheral conditions of the particular system implementation in hand (compare [\[KOR09\]\)](#page-244-7).

The security considerations start with the involved system components. These can be divided (e.g. for the application area "Electronic Employee ID Card") in direct components of the **contactless interface**,

- **-** the c**arrier medium** which encloses or activates deposited entitlements
- **-** the applied **terminals** (i.e. reader devices**)**

and the indirect RFID components which are

- **-** the **management systems** (e.g. the software applications and the backend system) as well as
- **- key management** which are always necessary.

Based on these components different kinds of **data** is processed, a **role model** is defined and **functions** that are associated with these roles are described. An overview of these interactions is presented in figure [6.](#page-31-0)

<span id="page-30-0"></span><sup>7</sup> Here, the system component that requires the less expenses for attacks have to be considered.

![](_page_31_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-31-0"></span>*Figure 6: System model for security considerations*

After the introduction of the initial situation - mainly the system model (compare section [2\)](#page-13-0) and the role model (compare section [3.2\)](#page-20-0) - the processes (compare section [6\)](#page-35-0) have to be analysed and described in more detail. Based on the application area and connected application scenarios a structure for the main processes and use cases (compare section [7\)](#page-47-0) is outlined. Thus, a model is retrieved which allows to identify passive and active attacks as well as threats which are used in the following for description of the relevant safeguards.

In the following sections a more detailed overview of the security consideration is presented. More and example information can be found in [\[KOR09\].](#page-244-7)

### **5.2.3.1 Definition of security targets**

All considerations of TR RFID are based on the classic definition of security targets as shown in figure [7.](#page-32-0)

![](_page_32_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-32-0"></span>*Figure 7: Generic security targets*

In particular the presented superior categories are examined in more detail:

- **-** Safety as protection of unpredictable failures
- **-** Information security as protection against intended attacks
- **-** Privacy as protection of informational self-determination

As a consequence role specific security targets can be defined in a table schema (compare table [1\)](#page-66-1) representing the different objectives of the according instances.

### <span id="page-32-1"></span>**5.2.3.2 Estimation of the protection demand**

After identifying all relevant security targets a selection of adequate safeguards can be connected. Hereby, an estimation of the protection demand for every single security target is necessary. This is done by answering the question which damage occurs if a specific security target is negatively affected either by failure of the IT system or by intended attacks.

Possible answers can be found by estimating the damage

- **-** based on the application scenario or
- **-** based on the processed information.

If the afore described analysis is done for all security targets a protection demand table is retrieved that assigns every security target to three protection demand categories. These categories describe which damage has to be expected if the respective security target is violated.

### **5.2.3.3 Determination of threats**

Section [5.2.3.2](#page-32-1) implies that threats have an effect on the considered IT system and as a consequence influence the objectives of the security targets. In order to perform a detailed threat analysis of the system components the following needs to be considered:

- **-** impacts which arise from threats to the overall system and
- **-** which protection demand categories are affected if a specific threat occurs.

The threat analysis returns all relevant threats which are achieved by experts' workshops and established checklists. Within this scope all components that are referenced by the defined use cases have to be considered.

By applying the afore described steps to all components a table (compare table [13\)](#page-81-0) is retrieved that assigns all component specific threats to the violated security targets.

Furthermore a matching table that shows the connection between security targets and threats can be obtained from section [14.](#page-248-0)

#### **5.2.3.4 Overall consideration of the system components**

Within the technical guidelines for RFID some components are realised in every application scenario. These are the backend system and the key management system that are part of the main infrastructure and are therefore related to as infrastructure components.

As a consequence, the security considerations for these components are realised within an overall and global layer.

For the determination of all relevant safeguards the following concept has been developed:

- 1. The security targets are assigned to protection demand categories based on the according infrastructure components.
- 2. The protection demand of the security targets is assigned to the corresponding threats.
- 3. The identified threats are set in contrast with the counteracting safeguards.
- 4. The protection demand is transferred from the threats to the corresponding safeguards such that the mechanisms strength is defined.

By applying the afore described steps to all infrastructure components a table of safeguards including the corresponding mechanism strength is retrieved that is independent from the application scenario.

#### **5.2.3.5 Specification of application specific safeguards**

In accordance with the determination of safeguards for the infrastructure components further safeguards have to be identified for the specific application scenario. This is done as follows:

- 1. The security targets are assigned to protection demand categories based on the according product specific application scenario.
- 2. The protection demand of the security targets is assigned to the corresponding threats.
- 3. The identified threats are set in contrast with the counteracting safeguards.
- 4. The protection demand is transferred from the threats to the corresponding safeguards such that the mechanisms strength is defined.

By applying the afore described steps to all application specific components a list of safeguards including the corresponding mechanism strength is retrieved. This is done in correspondence with the application scenario.

### **5.2.3.6 Conclusion**

After a complete description of the system architecture and a security analysis has been performed the user of this technical guideline receives an easy to use package of safeguards which is suited for the respective application scenario.

As a consequence a user shall only need to perform an explicit security analysis if the available infrastructure or application scenario shows significant differences to the described application areas.

In conclusion the overall procedure for the security consideration is presented in figure [8.](#page-34-0)

![](_page_34_Figure_8.jpeg)

<span id="page-34-0"></span>*Figure 8: Concept of security considerations*

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>**6 Generic business processes**

## <span id="page-35-3"></span>**6.1 Process P1: Concept phase**

Before the introduction of an electronic Employee ID Card within an organisation it is highly recommended to describe all requirements and conditions of the system architecture within a detailed specification.

By this means, an adequate system solution is obtained which can be analysed in particular in the meaning of cost-benefit ratio. Furthermore prospective and strategic objectives can be observed such as expandability, scalability, and interoperability.

This approach allows an organisation on the one hand to identify the specific components, processes, and resources that have to be considered and on the other hand which security level shall be achieved (this is described in more detail in section [8\)](#page-64-0). As a consequence the feasibility of the different requirements can be evaluated based on security considerations that are described within this technical guideline.

The concept of the system solution shall also contain a plan for the provision of the overall system. This includes the delivery period for all hardware (e.g. terminals and computer systems) and software components (e.g. management system and applications of the organisation) as well as information regarding the necessary integration complexity (e.g. description and connection of the different interfaces) for the applications of the organisation.

## <span id="page-35-2"></span>**6.2 Process P2: Registration of an employee**

If a new employee joins an organisation his work is connected with different levels of entitlements. The right management is often represented by the issuance of an electronic Employee ID Card. Therefore, at the very beginning, the employee has to register and if biometrics are applied an enrolment is necessary. Based on the established workflow in an organisation different procedures are possible.

In general, two different approaches can be taken into account:

- **-** The organisation can decide to issue a separate electronic Employee ID Card that is specially produced with a separate carrier medium or
- **-** it can be decided to establish a system solution that is based on electronic governmental ID cards providing an eID application[8](#page-35-1) that is usable for eBusiness.

In the following a short overview of the different approaches is given:

1. Service Point

The organisation establishes a service point that is concerned with the registration of new employees and later with changes of entitlements. At first, the employee has to fill out a prepared application form of the organisation or alternatively this can be done electronically by a service terminal. Further information of the ID Card system, privacy information and operating

<span id="page-35-1"></span><sup>8</sup> If applicable an eSign application can be used for further application scenarios within an organisation.

guidelines are provided to the employee. Afterwards the data is transferred (if not already done, it is transformed electronically) to the central management information system (CMIS). An electronic Employee ID Card can also be used in connection with biometrics. For example fingerprint recognition is one possibility and for the enrolment one or more fingerprints can be stored on the ID Card. The enrolment shall be performed at the service point under supervision of the service provider. This is necessary in order to assure by organisational means that the actual biometric feature (e.g. fingerprints) of the employee are captured. If biometrics are used the considerations described in section [2.1](#page-13-2) shall be taken into account.

In any case the identity of the employee for the correct assignment of entitlements has to be ensured e.g. by checking the ID card or in coordination with human resources.

2. Webservice

The registration of new employees can also be initiated by a specific automated webservice of the respective organisation. The operation of this service is assigned to the department of human resources. The necessary application data is inserted over a specific website in accordance with the backend systems. The identity check of the employee is performed based on the master data of the human resources.

If visitors are provided with an electronic carrier medium this can be initiated by the entry port by calling a dedicated web site of the organisation.

3. Webservice with eID

If an organisation uses governmental identity documents that can be used for public applications the eID card of an employee has to be registered to the CMIS of the organisation. Due to the security mechanisms of an eID (e.g. Extended Access Control [\[EAC10\]\)](#page-244-1) an explicit identity check is not necessary because this is already done during application of the eID document. Nevertheless, it shall be ensured that the eID document is still valid i.e. not revoked.

[Figure 9](#page-37-0) gives an overview of the different possibilities for registration of an employee. Processes P2.1 to P2.4 require an explicit identification of the employee. This can be achieved by the provision of an identity card e.g. German Personalausweis or comparable.

#### 6 Generic business processes

<span id="page-37-0"></span>*Figure 9: Diagram of Process 2, registration of an employee*

## <span id="page-37-1"></span>**6.3 Process P3: Personalisation and delivery**

Based on process P2 "registration of an employee" two cases for the application of an electronic Employee ID Card are described in the following:

- 1. Production and issuance of an electronic Employee ID Card with separate and specially produced carrier medium (contactless smart card or contactless multi-application card).
- 2. Assignment of the entitlements with an existing eID card.

The personalisation and later usage (compare section [6.4\)](#page-41-0) of the carrier medium, independent of the applied carrier medium, is performed in association with a comprehensive management system. Typically, the management system includes different subsystems. In this technical guideline the subparts of the management system as described in section [2.1](#page-13-2) are applied. Nevertheless in practice, a system solution is in most cases obtained from one source. Thus, the organisation only integrates its applications by requesting defined interfaces of the management system. The backend systems encloses the following subsystems:

**-** Applications of the organisation

The application can be in the possession of the organisation or can be provided by an external product provider as a service. A employee needs an adequate entitlement in order to apply an application.

**-** Life cycle management system

The management of the carrier medium is encapsulated with the life cycle management. All requested services that have influence of the carrier medium are combined within this part (e.g. initialisation, personalisation, loading of application data or writing of entitlements to the carrier medium).

**-** Key Management

The key management provides all functionality that is necessary to establish the adequate security mechanism.

- **-** Central Management Information System (CMIS) The CMIS provides all functionality to control and administer the complete system.
- **-** Whitelists or blacklists

Represent the actual state of entitlements within the overall system. If offline or semi-offline systems are used this mechanism is used to update the right management of the terminals.

**-** Electronic terminal

While the electronic Employee ID Card represents the identity of a specific person the CMIS provides all administration for the control system. The communication between both components is established by the application of electronic terminals. In an online operating system the electronic terminal is directly connected to the management system and obtains recent information. In the offline or semi-offline case revocation information needs to be made available to the terminal explicitly.

[Figure 10](#page-39-0) shows the personalisation and delivery process P3 that represents the description for the setup for a new employee and the delivery steps afterwards:

#### 6 Generic business processes

![](_page_39_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-39-0"></span>*Figure 10: Diagram of Process 3, personalisation and delivery*

The delivery for the electronic Employee ID Card can be realised as follows:

1. Collection from entry port (by visitors)

In case a visitor shall receive an electronic ID Card of an organisation as shown in process P3.1 a respective entry in the backend system has to be established by creation of a visitor account. Afterwards the carrier medium can be initialised and issued. Usually, in comparison to the standard electronic Employee ID Cards that are issued to the employees entitlements for visitors are restricted such that only specific services are provided e.g. the visitor can use the payment application in a cafeteria of the according organisation. As an example limitation can depend on time or area restrictions.

2. Service Point

Processes P3.2 and P3.3 describe the direct collection of the ID card at the service point within an organisation. The only difference between both processes is the time of pickup direct or later. In the case of process P3.2 an additional authentication check is necessary in order to assure the ID card is submitted to the correct identity[9](#page-39-1) . In general, the personalisation starts with the

<span id="page-39-1"></span><sup>9</sup> Note: For process P3.3 this has already been done within process P2.2.

creation of the user account in the central management information system (CMIS). This can be done in advance in accordance with human resources or can be done when the employee registers at the service point. A carrier medium is initialised in particular with application parameters and personalisation information. By consulting the software applications, CMIS, and the connected key management entitlements and card applications are assigned to the carrier medium.

3. Using existing eID card

In case an eID card of the employee - that can be used for eBusiness - is applied no issuance of an additional document is necessary. Nevertheless, a user account for the administration of the employee data needs to be created. Hereby, entitlements and applications can be assigned and stored in the management system since the storage of this data in the eID document is usually not possible since they are not extendible for further applications.

*Note:* Due to privacy reasons it is not recommended to allow the unauthorised and plain exchange of (unique) information which is linked to the single carrier medium (like a UID) or linked to a single application or to a single group of users. Thereby, the possibilities to generate movement profiles by unauthorised parties gets more likely. It is recommended to use a random ID for selecting the carrier medium and to use an authentication with a secret key, followed by an encrypted communication, which guarantees confidentiality of the exchanged data, to retrieve the unique information of the carrier medium like the UID.

Fault cases are not dealt with here.

## <span id="page-41-0"></span>**6.4 Process P4: Usage**

![](_page_41_Figure_2.jpeg)

*Figure 11: Diagram of Process 4, usage*

After an employee has received an electronic Employee ID Card (compare process P3) with approved card applications and valid entitlements and the system infrastructure for the applications is set up the services of the organisation can be used. In case an offline or semi-offline scenario is applied the respective blocking information has to be made available to the electronic terminals.

For the correct application of the entitlements the employee has to show the ID Card to a RF-Terminal of the organisation.

In case an eID card is used the authentication is performed based on ownership (i.e. the eID document) and knowledge (i.e. the secret PIN) of the employee. Thus, it can be ensured that only the according employee can use the service.

If a separate electronic Employee ID Card is used three authentication procedures are possible. Based on the security level and the requirements ownership, ownership and knowledge, or ownership and inherence can be used. The identity of the employee and/or his entitlements are checked. If all checks are successful access to the application of the organisation is granted.

In most cases the execution of an application consists mainly of the authentication process since the handling of the application is mainly performed within the management system. In some cases an execution is performed on the carrier medium. As an example the payment application shall be referenced. In this application scenario two different realisation alternatives are possible. The application can either be executed mainly in the management system by keeping a shadow account in the backend system or it can be realised with a prepaid function where a specific amount of payment units is loaded on the carrier medium. This value is decreased when the payment application is applied.

Due to the fact that conditions in an organisation can change applications and entitlements can change over the time. This means that new applications can be introduced in the organisation and respective entitlements need to be issued or the opposite case happens where applications are deactivated. Therefore functionality for the loading and activation of new applications need to be established as well as functionality for the deactivation of applications and entitlements. An overview of these processes is given in figure [12.](#page-43-0)

Fault cases are not dealt with here.

## **6.5 Process P5: Blocking and Unblocking**

*Figure 13: Diagram of Process 5, blocking and unblocking of entitlements*

In order to control the applications and entitlements of an electronic Employee ID Cards, it is advantageous to provide mechanisms to block and unblock entitlements of according applications and carrier media securely. This helps the processes of cancelling and exchanging carrier media and entitlements and enables lost media to be replaces. Within organisations employee ID Cards are often only temporarily unavailable so that fallback solutions - a second identity card - can be issued. If a second carrier medium is assigned to an employee and the respective entitlements are set this is logged within the corresponding user account.

In general, two scenarios are possible:

- 1. A carrier medium is temporarily blocked because it is not available to the employee (e.g. the employee has forgotten the ID Card at home). In this case a logging of the single card activities within the time of two cards of the employee (one temporarily activated and one temporarily deactivated) can be conducted if applicable.
- 2. A carrier medium is lost and therefore completely blocked (i.e. it will not be unblocked). In this case deregistration (compare process P6) is undertaken and a new card will be issued (compare process P2).

For the blocking and unblocking mechanism two different scenarios can be distinguished. If the system works completely online the blocking information is assembled within a list in the CMIS and can be accessed by the terminals. If the system infrastructure uses an offline scenario the blocking information needs to be made available trough manual processes.

## **6.6 Process P6: Deregistration**

If an employee leaves an organisation the carrier medium with the enclosed entitlements and applications has to be returned and the user account is closed. The process is shown in figure [14.](#page-45-0)

![](_page_45_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-45-0"></span>*Figure 14: Diagram of Process 6, deregistration*

At first all entitlements - if not already done - are blocked. The blocking information is compiled in a list and made known to the overall system so that the specific electronic Employee ID Card cannot be used for any service. The explicit distribution is necessary in particular if the system

infrastructure supports offline scenarios. Afterwards the user account is closed. The process of deregistering ends when the carrier medium is returned e.g. if an employee leaves the organisation .

If the carrier medium is lost an additional entry is made in the user account respectively in the CMIS.

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>**7 Use cases**

This section describes the main use cases that are considered by applying an electronic Employee ID Card. In particular the carrier medium with the contactless interface is observed in more detail and its interaction with further system components. The use cases are derived from the generic process description in section [6.](#page-35-0)

Since the implementation of the management systems and the connected applications is in large parts dependent of the solution of the respective provider the description of the use cases has example character and is used to illustrate a possible architecture that is discussed in more detail in section [10.](#page-146-0)

In this technical guideline the following use cases are considered:

- **-** Enrolment (optional in case biometrics is taken into account)
- **-** Identification of the employee
- **-** Create user account or retrieve already existing user account
- **-** Initialisation of the carrier medium
- **-** Delivery
- **-** Authentication
- **-** Assignment of entitlement
- **-** Loading and activation of new applications
- **-** Deactivation of applications and entitlements
- **-** Blocking
- **-** Unblocking
- **-** Key management
	- **-** Key management for the initialisation of the carrier medium
	- **-** Key management for the loading and personalisation of applications
	- **-** Key management for the assignment of entitlements
	- **-** Key management for the assignment in the organisation
- **-** Deregistration

## **7.1 The "Enrolment" use case**

In general, the acquisition of biometric features of an employee must be specified in accordance with the working council or a comparable instance and the data protection official of the respective organisation. The acquisition process shall be performed at a computer system which is in the possession of the security manager and can only be accesses by the according entitlement.

In the following an example regarding fingerprints is given. For the acquisition process assistance can be obtained in [\[TT05\]a](#page-244-2)nd [\[TT08\].](#page-244-3) A terminal that encloses a biometric fingerprint sensor is connected to the computer system and an enrolment application is installed that can be administered only by the security manager. An identity card in the reading range of the terminal is coded with a biometric feature e.g. one or two fingerprints are captured with the connected fingerprint sensor and imported in the card as reference. This is done with the help of the enrolment application. The second fingerprint can be captured as a fallback possibility so that matching of one fingerprint is also possible if the other finger is injured.

The security manager has to ensure by organisational means that the enrolment is correct e.g. that the applicant does not use fake fingers. The description of the organisational safeguards is not part of this technical guideline.

## **7.2 The "Identification of employee" use case**

Entitlements are assigned to a specific person in an organisation in order to provide access to applications. Therefore, it is important to ensure that an electronic identity is connected to the right person. As a consequence, the reliability of the employee data and the later correct use of the electronic Employee ID Cards is bounded to a successful identification or authentication of the respective person. The identification is represented through the processes P2.1 – P2.5 whereas in the last case implicit authentication is performed by using an eID application. In the other cases identification is checked e.g. by presenting an identity card. By using a reliable process the increase of security will be ensured.

## **7.3 The "Create user account or retrieve already existing user account" use case**

Since the assignment of entitlements in an organisation is usually provided in long terms the carrier medium is normally not used for only a few applications but for many authentication processes. This may require the storage of employee data (and if applicable personal data of the employee if agreed) that has been received during registration (compare section [6.2\)](#page-35-2) in particular within the management system.

In general, employee data can be stored either in the carrier medium or in the management system. The decision for one or the other possibility depends highly on the requirements of an organisation. Because the storage of data is limited on the carrier medium side and eID documents do normally not support the storage of additional data this technical guideline focuses on the approach to store the employee data in the management system.

The main data is transferred electronically and assigned to an user account that is generated at first. As a consequence, the management system acts as the counterpart of the carrier medium by administrating the important data, functions, and applications for an employee.

If a governmental eID document shall be used within an organisation further requirements need to be established e.g. the German nPA (eID document for public use) is based on [\[EAC10\].](#page-244-1) If the eID application shall be used in an organisation the authority or company needs to apply for an certificate that assigns the according entitlements for the desired applications. With such a certificate and the agreement of the card holder (which is shown by entering the private PIN) services or respectively applications of the organisation can be used. As an example selected data can be exchanged between the eID document of the document holder and the organisation which can be used within the scope of the user account in the following.

## <span id="page-49-0"></span>**7.4 The "Initialisation of the carrier medium" use case**

If a separate identity document can be used in an organisation as electronic Employee ID Card it has to be initialised and personalised for a specific employee. All the functions that have to be performed to initialise and manage the carrier medium are accomplished by the Life Cycle Management System. In many cases the carrier media are blank when they are used for initialisation and personalisation. Before or after this process the visual characteristics can be printed e.g. a photo of the employee.

While the initialisation encloses general data (e.g. the structure that is pretended of the organisation) the personalisation phase stores personal data and cryptographic parameters e.g. individual keys on the carrier medium.

The use case "Initialisation of the carrier medium" includes the following phases:

- 1. Setting of the carrier medium
	- **-** Setting of the file structure (e.g. master files and if applicable elementary files) that has been specified within the respective organisation.
	- **-** Setup of the Access Control List which is later used for the access to the applications based on the according entitlements.
	- **-** Setting of an administrator key which allows access of the security manager to the carrier medium.
	- **-** Registration of the carrier medium for a specific employee in the management system (i.e. assignment to the according user account).
	- **-** Note: it can be advantageous already to prepare the carrier medium for future applications.
- 2. Creation card applications
	- **-** Storing the relevant card applications (elementary files) on the carrier medium. This includes the individual structures (dedicated files) and the ID that are defined for a specific application.
	- **-** Registration of the applications in the user account. Thus, the logic connection between the user account and the card applications on the carrier medium is performed. This is important

for the later usage e.g. if the electronic Employee ID Card is lost and the respective applications and connected entitlements shall be blocked.

- **-** Generation and storage of cryptographic keys for the administrator within the scope of the card applications.
- 3. Update
	- **-** After the structure of an application has been generated the application parameters and additional data can be loaded. This can be data regarding the employee and/or IDs that are used for a specific service.In accordance with human resources respectively the data protection official these information is aligned with the user account.
	- **-** The entitlements are assigned and afterwards activated.
	- **-** Specific cryptographic keys of the employee are generated and applied on the carrier medium.

![](_page_51_Figure_1.jpeg)

*Figure 15: Use case "Initialisation of the carrier medium"*

The *administrator key* is used for the general administration of the card structure and allows to establish an adequate access control list (ACL).

The *application administrator key* describes the key for a specific application which is in the possession of the application provider and is used to administrate the application.

Finally, the *application key* is used only for the execution of this specific application.

## **7.5 The "Delivery" use case**

Carrier media that have been initialised and loaded with entitlements must finally be passed to the employee. Therefore, the electronic Employee ID Card is delivered to the service point or already produced there. This is described in processes P3.1 – P3.3. After the carrier medium is in possession of the respective holder, the system manager has to register the process in the management system such that the media is in the possession of the employee or a new card has been issued after loss or damage.

In case of a governmental eID document the use case is not applied since the document is already in possession of the holder.

## **7.6 The "Authentication" use case**

In any case an authentication has to be performed in order to enable an electronic terminal to check if an employee owns the entitlements for a specific application.

At first, based on the requirements of the organisation an authentication of the user of the card is expected that uses:

- **-** ownership,
- **-** ownership and knowledge, or
- **-** ownership and inherence
	- **-** verification can be performed on the carrier medium (match-on-card) or within the terminal respectively the management system.

If the authentication is successful, the application can be accessed and a mutual authentication between the carrier medium and the terminal can be performed.

Afterwards the entitlements for this application can be checked and the application can be executed.

In many cases the application only requires a simple authentication of the employee because the logic of the application is included in the management system. Nevertheless, some applications e.g. payment can be connected to further processing steps. If problems are encountered during processing an error is displayed and the user has to contact the help desk for further support.

Fault cases are not considered in this technical guideline but shall be part of the specification of the system.

![](_page_53_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-53-0"></span>**7.7 The "Assignment of entitlement" use case** *Figure 16: Use Case "Authentication"*

Due to the fact that requirements and conditions in an organisation can be subject of change there exists a need to change entitlements that have been assigned to an employee. The use case is to be distinguished from blocking of entitlements which is described in section [7.10.](#page-57-0)

As an example an employee can be allowed to accede additional areas of the organisation after his responsibilities have been changed or the organisation can decide to grant benefits that shall be indicated with the electronic Employee ID Card. Figure [17](#page-54-0) shows that an authentication with the application has to be performed at first and afterwards the entitlements of an employee but also of the administrator of the application can be adapted.

| Use Case "Assignment of entitlement"       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                            |                                                                                                     |                                                  |

<span id="page-54-0"></span>*Figure 17: Use Case "Assignment of entitlement"*

## **7.8 The "Loading and activation of new applications" use case**

Besides the need to change entitlements during the lifetime of an identification system as described in the use case "assignment of entitlements" (compare section [7.7\)](#page-53-0) it can be necessary to load new applications and to set this new application into operation. This process is described in figure [18.](#page-55-0) Thereby the file structure of the new card application is inserted in the carrier medium and the according entitlements as well as the required application data are set.

![](_page_55_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-55-0"></span>*Figure 18: Use Case "Loading and activation of new application"*

## **7.9 The "Deactivation of applications and entitlements" use case**

As counterpart to the "loading and activation of new applications" use case an operation has to be specified that allows to deregister applications and entitlements. This is achieved by the "deactivation of applications and entitlements" use case. It allows to stop the operation of applications and connected entitlements. The state of the applications and entitlements need to be logged in the user account in order to enable the security manager to retrieve the actual state of the system. The use cases is shown in figure [19.](#page-56-0)

Depending of the requirements of an organisation the use case of deactivation can include the complete deletion of the application or the application might remain on the carrier medium. In any case the application and connected entitlements are blocked.

![](_page_56_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-56-0"></span>*Figure 19: Use Case "Deactivation of applications and entitlements"*

## <span id="page-57-0"></span>**7.10 The "Blocking" use case**

In case an electronic Employee ID Card is not available or is considered to be compromised the holder shall apply for blocking the respective carrier medium. It is in the responsibility of the security manager to provide services for the fast and effective blocking of the entitlement(s), application(s), and/or the complete carrier medium (compare figure [20\)](#page-57-1). The state of the carrier medium has to be written to the user account for later follow up.

The new blocking state of the entitlement, application, and/or carrier medium is then compiled with the help of whitelists and blacklists. If an entitlement, application or the complete carrier medium is withdrawn it is no longer on the whitelist but added to the blacklist. This information is afterwards made available to the overall system. In case of an offline system or an semi-offline system the information has to be distributed explicitly.

![](_page_57_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-57-1"></span>*Figure 20: Use Case "Blocking"*

## **7.11 The "Unblocking" use case**

If the blocking of an electronic Employee ID Card is no longer necessary the process has to be reversed. This is done by unblocking the carrier medium respectively the application or entitlement. Again, it is in the responsibility of the security manager to provide services for the fast and effective unblocking of the entitlement(s), application(s), and/or the complete carrier medium (compare figure [21\)](#page-58-0). The state of the carrier medium has to be written to the user account for later follow up.

The new unblocking state of the entitlement, application, and/or carrier medium is then compiled with the held of whitelists and blacklists. If an entitlement, application, or the complete carrier medium had been withdrawn it is no longer on the blacklist but added to the whitelist. This information is afterwards made available to the overall system. In case of an offline system or a semi-offline system the information has to be distributed explicitly.

![](_page_58_Figure_4.jpeg)

<span id="page-58-0"></span>*Figure 21: Use Case "Unblocking"*

## **7.12 The "Key management" use case**

For the protection of entitlements on the carrier medium usually symmetric keys are used due to performance reasons. Therefore, the security and operability of the overall system highly depends on the secure provision and administration of keys. This task has to be performed by the key management and the according processes.

In the following presentation of use cases **Secure Authentication Modules** (**SAM**) are used for secure storage of key information, security mechanisms, and diversification algorithms. In principle, other concepts for proceeding are possible.

For the initialisation of the carrier medium and for the storage of entitlements a key management is necessary that considers the hierarchical relationship regarding the carrier medium, applications, and products/entitlements.

### **7.12.1 Key management for the initialisation of the carrier medium**

Figure [22](#page-60-0) describes the use case key management for the initialisation of the carrier medium. The keys and procedures that are defined in the following are also used for the adding of applications.

Note: Due to privacy reasons it is not recommended to allow the unauthorised and plain exchange of (unique) information which is linked to the single carrier medium (like a UID) or linked to a single application or to a single group of users. Thereby, the possibilities to generate movement profiles by unauthorised parties gets more likely. It is recommended to use a random ID for selecting the carrier medium and to use an authentication with a secret key, followed by an encrypted communication, which guarantees confidentiality of the exchanged data, to retrieve the unique information of the carrier medium like the UID.

![](_page_60_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-60-0"></span>*Figure 22: Use case "Key management for the initialisation of the carrier medium"*

### **7.12.2 Key management for the loading and personalisation of applications**

In order to secure applications that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the applications.

Figure [23](#page-61-0) shows the corresponding use case. The key management system for carrier media also has to be available when the application is loaded onto the carrier medium.

![](_page_61_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-61-0"></span>*Figure 23: Key management for applications*

### **7.12.3 Key management for the loading of entitlements**

In order to secure entitlements that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the products.

Figure [24](#page-62-0) shows the corresponding use case. The key management system for applications also has to be available when the entitlement is loaded onto the application.

![](_page_62_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-62-0"></span>*Figure 24: Use Case: "Key management for entitlements"*

### **7.12.4 Key management for the use in the organisation**

For the application of a system infrastructure that supports secure communication between the electronic Employee ID Card and the management system in an organisation an adequate key management needs to be established. Since the management system consists of the applications and connected backend systems adequate security mechanisms need to be established that allow the initialisation of the carrier medium and the assignment of respective entitlements.

Keys are used within the scope of the electronic terminals and the backend systems. In case of eID documents furthermore certificates with according entitlements need to be available for the organisation and the authorised instances.

The key management is in the responsibility of the security manager. Thus, specific SAMs are provided to offer all functionality that are necessary for key management.

## **7.13 The "Deregistration" use case**

If an employee leaves the organisation the carrier medium needs to be returned in order to avoid unauthorised misuse. This can additionally be regulated by the employees' contract.

Nevertheless, if the carrier medium is available or not the entitlements, applications, and the carrier medium have to be blocked and a deregistration entry is made in the respective user account.

![](_page_63_Figure_7.jpeg)

*Figure 25: Use case "Deregistration"*

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>**8.1 Definitions relating to security and privacy**

Security can be divided into three aspects or categories, which are all examined in more detail in this document. These are:

- **-** Safety
- **-** Information security
- **-** Data privacy

The afore described categories can be subdivided as follows:

#### 1. **Safety**

Safety is often confused with reliability/correctness or quality of service. Reliability means that the system is operating correctly according to a defined specification. Experiences show that every technical system is sometimes subject to failure. Safety describes the system characteristic that a system does not change in an undefined state if a failure occurs which would lead to a hazard for the system itself or the direct environment (fail-safe). At the same time, the system shall also continue as far as possible in compliance with its specification (fault tolerance). Therefore, safety basically implies protection against unintended incidents.

#### 2. **Information security**

In opposite to safety information security offers protection against internal attacks. In the area of information security security targets are assigned to the following categories:

- a. Confidentiality: confidentiality means protection against the unauthorised disclosure of information. Confidential data and information may only be accessible to authorised people in an authorised manner. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information or such information that shall be communicated has to be protected against unauthorised access of third parties.
- b. Integrity: integrity means ensuring correctness of data (i.e. that the data is unchanged) and correct functionality of systems. In terms of protection this means: stored information or such information that shall be communicated has to be protected against unauthorised alteration.
- c. Availability: the availability of services, functionality of IT systems, IT applications, or IT networks and even of information, exist if they are always available to their users as required. In terms of protection this means: information and resources have to be protected against improperly withheld.
- d. Unlinkability: unlinkability between two communication elements within one system means that those two communication elements are not any more or less in relationship with each other than it was known before. Within this system no further information regarding the relationship of those two communication elements can be obtained. Practically, this means e.g. that one can make use of services or resources more than one time without any third party knowing that these requests (within a communication model: messages) are related to this user.
- e. Unobservability: an event is unobservable, if it cannot be determined if it is going to happen or not. Therefore, sender-unobservability means that it cannot be recognised if messages are sent at all. Recipient-unobservability is defined in the same way, it cannot be determined if messages are received or not. Relationship-unobservability means that from the set of possible senders it cannot be determined if messages are sent to the possible set of recipients.
- f. Anonymity: anonymity describes the state in which one cannot be identified within an anonymity group. By using the term unlinkability, anonymity can be more precisely defined as the unlinkability of the identity of a user and an event initiated by that user. Therefore sender-anonymity exists as unlinkability between sender and message and recipientanonymity exists as unlinkability between a message and the recipient.
- g. Authenticity: the term authenticity designates a situation in which the communication partner is actually the person that he or she claimed to be. With authenticated information it is ensured that this information comes from the stated source. The term is not only used when people's identity is checked, but also for IT components and applications.
- h. Non-repudiation: Sending or receiving messages from authenticated people has to be ensured against denying later on.
- i. Accountability: accountability joins together the IT security targets authenticity and nonrepudiation. In the context of transmission of information this means that the source of the information has correctly proven its identity and that the receipt of the message cannot be denied.

### **3. Privacy**

The purpose of privacy is to protect against violation of the personal rights of the individual through the handling of his personal data.

Privacy refers to the protection of personal data against possible misuse by third parties (not to be confused with data security) [\[EU\\_REF\].](#page-244-8)

#### **Other definitions**

Furthermore the following additional terms are used uniformly:

#### **1. Security targets**

Security targets represent security relevant objectives that have to be considered by implementing an IT system. In this document specific security targets are identified and specified for the respective application areas and application scenarios. Violations of the security targets causes direct damage to the entity whose security target is violated.

### **2. Threats**

Threats are immediate risks to the security targets of an application.

These may be the result of an active attack on one or more security targets by exploiting the systems weakness, or they may take the form of potential vulnerabilities in the system such as the lack of a fallback solution.

#### **3. Safeguards**

Safeguards are a precise and recommended course of actions that counteract one or more threats. The safeguards described in this document are intended to be applied meaningfully and in accordance with the respective requirements, i.e. they are suggested on the basis of economic

feasibility and resistance to manipulation: (How expensive is the implementation of a safeguard, and what are the financial damages that can be limited or prevented by it?

### **4. Residual risk**

Normally it is not possible to counteract every single threat in such a way that a system offers absolute security. Therefore, the residual risk describes the risk that remains after a set of safeguards have been implemented and attacks are nevertheless possible. The level of this risk depends on the counter-measures that can be applied, how complex they are, and, in particular, what the costs are in relation to the benefits for the entity involved. The entity has to take explicit liability for the residual risk.

## <span id="page-66-0"></span>**8.2 Definition of the security targets**

Seldom the security aspects for safety, information security, and privacy are evaluated equally important or even relevant in all cases considering a specific application scenario. The first challenge when designing a secure RFID system is therefore to formulate specific security targets.

Based on the afore described generic security targets (compare figure [7\)](#page-32-0), superior and application area specific security targets are identified for an electronic Employee ID Card:

- 1. Protection of electronic entitlements (represents the protection targets integrity and authenticity)
- 2. Safety of the RFID system
- 3. Protection of the employee's data privacy (representing the protection targets confidentiality, unlinkability, unobservability, anonymity, and privacy as general requirements)

Considering the security targets of the different entities (compare section [8.2\)](#page-66-0) in the following sections an overview of the overall view of security targets can be presented in section [8.2.4.](#page-77-0)

The following table shows the scheme for the coding of security targets as well as used abbreviations.

This would cause inconvenience and possible<br>damage to the employee e.g. if the payment application is<br>used by a third party. Furthermore the employee can be<br>excluded from his assigned rights and might later be asked to<br>prove that the service was not used by him. |  |

| SEI3                          | Protection of usage<br>data                | Usage data is applied e.g. for accounting the garage or cafeteria<br>and can also be accumulated for time registration. This data must<br>therefore be reliable, authentic and integer.                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |
| SEI4                          | Avoidance of fraud<br>or coalition attacks | The coalition of several instances (e.g. application providers,<br>product providers and in particular service providers) to achieve<br>information that is usually not available shall not be possible. This<br>is in particular of concern regarding personal data of the<br>employee.                                                                                  |  |

## <span id="page-78-1"></span>**8.2.5 Definition of protection demand categories**

Three protection demand categories are constituted on the basis of the security targets described in section [8.2.4.](#page-77-0) Category 1 represents the lowest protection demand, category 3 the highest.

The following table lists the criteria for allocating protection requirements to protection demand categories[10](#page-78-0), these criteria being based on the assumption that no protective measures have been put in place.

## <span id="page-81-1"></span>**8.3 Threats**

In this section the potential threats regarding the security targets are described which have been introduced in section [8.2.](#page-66-0) Hereby, the different components of the infrastructure are considered. Those are:

- 1. Contactless Interface
- 2. Carrier medium
- 3. Terminal
- 4. Key Management
- 5. Management System (backend system with applications)

Following the description of the security targets a schema based on tables is used to present the threats in accordance with the respective component. An overview is given in table [13.](#page-81-0)

## <span id="page-91-1"></span>**8.4 Safeguards**

This section describes the safeguards that can be used to counter the threats that have been described in section [8.3.](#page-81-1) Since security targets can require different security levels the same is true for the safeguards that are used within the realisation. Therefore, safeguards are defined in a way that different levels are considered that are built successively upon each other. Based on the required security level the specific level of safeguards can be chosen based on a cost-benefit analysis.

Level 1 represents the lowest security category, level 3 the highest. Level 3+ is used to denote additional safeguards that increase the security of a system, but whose expense may exceed the value of the extra security gained disproportionately.

The security levels are aligned with the protection demand categories of the system. A threat to a security target that has been identified as protection demand category 3 shall be countered by safeguards of security level 3. Generally threats of a specific protection demand category can be countered by safeguards of the same or higher protection demand categories.

The following safeguards are generally not defined as isolated measures, but rather are to be understood as "safeguard packages". As a rule, the security of components, interfaces, and the overall system can only be increased in a meaningful way if safeguards are employed across the board as packages. Furthermore, alternative possibilities are defined within the security levels; for instance, a secure environment (which generally does not exist) can replace the encrypted storage of data. Table [19](#page-91-0) shows the scheme of events and the used abbreviations.

<span id="page-91-0"></span>*Table 19: Overview of the coding of safeguards*

In this technical guideline safeguards are considered for the system architecture whereas the following components will be considered in more detail:

- **-** the overall system (compare section [8.4.4\)](#page-125-0),
- **-** the carrier medium (compare section [8.4.3\)](#page-106-0)
- **-** terminals (compare section [8.4.4\)](#page-125-0) and
- **-** the key management system (compare section [8.4.5\)](#page-131-0).

### **8.4.1 Cryptographic parameters**

The following safeguards generally require cryptographic methods that shall follow the rules given in [\[ALGK\\_BSI\]. \[ALGK\\_BSI\]](#page-245-1) defines methods, key lengths, and the expectancy of life of those methods. [\[ALGK\\_BSI\]](#page-245-1) will be updated and made available to the public by BSI on a regular basis.

Existing implementations shall comply to the rules given in [\[ALGK\\_BSI\]](#page-245-1) or [\[TR\\_ECARD\].](#page-245-2) With the next evolution step existing systems shall be migrated in order to comply to [\[ALGK\\_BSI\].](#page-245-1) This update has to be carried out in an appropriate period of time.

Under this precondition, the utilisation of the TDES algorithm is still allowed for authentication, encryption and generation of MAC. Moreover the application AES128 is encouraged.

### <span id="page-93-1"></span>**8.4.2 Safeguards for the protection of the overall system**

The following safeguards are related to the overall system but can be applied in general to all system components such as the management system including the associated interfaces.

| 3               | For secure communication standard mechanisms for dynamic encryption (for example<br>SSL or TLS encrypted communication) can be used. If applicable, already established<br>public key infrastructure mechanisms can be supported (e.g. already existing certificates)<br>or the necessary mechanisms need to be introduced which means that well established<br>standard libraries can be applied to provide the respective mechanism (e.g. SSL or TLS<br>ensured connections). |                     |  |

|       | A system concept must be developed that defines the availability and fallback<br>-<br>solutions explicitly with availability periods and fallback intervals.                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |  |
|       | To minimise the system failure all critical components must be worked as redundant<br>-<br>systems.

|       | In case of biometrics: beyond the acquisition of a second biometric feature the<br>-<br>fallback of another method (e.g. using knowledge in place of inherence) must be<br>possible. The change of method shall be easily possible and logged within the user<br>account.                                                                |                   |  |

| Note    | It is assumed that the application for which the new entitlements are to be loaded<br>-<br>already exist. If it does not exist yet, then the safeguard "Loading new entitlements"<br>can be referenced (compare MCM11a and MCM11b).                                                                                                                                                       |                            |  |
|         | It must be ensured that entitlements carry unique references when stored on the carrier<br>-<br>medium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                            |  |
|         | If entitlement keys are to be loaded on the carrier medium, then the data must be<br>-<br>encrypted in every case (see MCM11b).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                            |  |

### <span id="page-125-0"></span>**8.4.4 Safeguards regarding the terminal**

The electronic terminals provide the connection between the carrier medium and the management system. Therefore, the description of safeguards regarding the terminal are connected to the overall system (compare section [8.4.2\)](#page-93-1) as well as the carrier medium (compare section [8.4.3\)](#page-106-0). Specific safeguards that depend directly on the terminal are described in the following:

|      | In electronic terminals the keys shall always be stored within encapsulated security<br>-<br>authentication modules (SAMs). In particular, this is also valid for offline, semi<br>offline terminals, as well as the corresponding backend systems e.g. keys for the<br>administration of user accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                     |  |
|      | Besides the generation of component specific keys the exchange of session keys is<br>-<br>performed which are received dynamically based on changeable data (e.g. random<br>number generators). This effectively prevents messages from being eavesdropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                     |  |

| 3       | All keys that are classified as important are provided redundant (i.e. a master and<br>-<br>slave concept is applied). This is true for SAMs and carrier media13. In case of a<br>disaster the state of the system is switched to disaster recovery and the slave key is<br>applied.                                                        |                   |
|         | Every time a RFID carrier medium communicates with the terminal, the emergency<br>-<br>version is used instead of the regular version – assuming this has not already<br>happened. To this end, suitable mechanisms must be maintained in the carrier medium<br>that prevent the regular version from being used later.                     |                   |
|         | The compromised keys shall be made unusable. This can be achieved by blocking all<br>-<br>respective keys, the collection of compromised carrier media and if applicable logging<br>of attempts to use a blocked key.                                                                                                                       |                   |
|         | If the security modules are altogether compromised and an emergency version of the<br>-<br>key is not available, then the security modules and therefore the carrier media must be<br>replaced immediately. The data in the system cannot be considered trustworthy until<br>all the security modules and carrier media have been replaced. |                   |

|         | Loading of new keys – securing the authenticity and integrity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | TKM1, TKM2        |
| General | Keys shall be associated clearly with an application or an entitlement, and when the<br>application or entitlement is loaded, they shall be imported into the carrier medium from<br>the SAM. An autonomous process for loading new keys is especially relevant for SAMs,<br>and is advisable at all levels. |                   |
|         | Note:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                   |
|         | If keys are used for central services - e.g. ensuring authenticity of the main mechanisms<br>of the system solution such as generation of new keys, loading of new applications or<br>entitlements or the like - they cannot be changed or overwritten since they build the core<br>elements of the system.  |                   |

|         | 1. Keys must each have a unique identifier containing information on the issuing<br>organisation, and a version number.                                                                                                                                                                                      |                   |
|         | 2. There shall be a way of deleting or blocking keys that have been expired or are<br>revoked.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                   |
|         | 3. New keys are loaded from a key management system into the SAM by the security<br>manager or an authorised entity; this requires an online connection.                                                                                                                                                     |                   |
|         | 4. Keys must always be loaded under confidential conditions, for which a decryption<br>key is required in the SAM.                                                                                                                                                                                           |                   |
|         | 5. A symmetric procedure is used for loading new keys, for which the key issuer has a<br>symmetric master key (KM_Storekey); derived from that, keys that are particular to<br>each card are stored in the SAMs (see II.)                                                                                    |                   |
|         | II. General procedure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                   |
|         | New keys are loaded using the following procedure:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                   |
|         | 1. The carrier medium sends its ID to the terminal, which passes it on to the SAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                   |
|         | 2. The SAM uses this to derive the card's specific key, K_Storekey, from the master key<br>(KM_Storekey).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                   |
|         | 3. The K_Storekey is used to perform authentication between the SAM and employee<br>carrier medium. A shared session key is negotiated for this purpose.                                                                                                                                                     |                   |
|         | 4. Once authentication has been completed successfully, the keys are encrypted using<br>the session key, and stored in the SAM.                                                                                                                                                                              |                   |
| 3       | Complex authentication concept                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                   |

# <span id="page-141-0"></span>**9 Definition of product-specific application scenarios**

The processes which have been examined in sections [6](#page-35-0) and [7](#page-47-0) will be considered for the realisation of particular products in the following.

The application scenarios within the field of electronic Employee ID Cards offer a wide range of properties that can be chosen by an individual company or authority solution. It is the objective of this technical guideline to analyse the most common and important application scenarios that have to be considered in the context of safety, information security, and privacy for the application area of an electronic Employee ID Card.

The results of this analysis will be used to specify recommendations for the technical realisation of the overall system and the according business processes.

The following application scenarios will be taken into account:

1. Application scenario "Access Control"

The establishment of adequate access control mechanisms is very important in organisations in order to grant access only to authorised people. Thereby different levels of access can be considered (e.g. to a the property of a company, a specific floor, or room). The objective of an electronic Employee ID Card is to provide an employee easy access to the resources of the organisation.

- 2. Application scenario "Time Registration" RFID technology can be established in an organisation to provide easy-to-use, flexible, and user friendly registration of working hours. The objective is to assign e.g. the registered start and end
	- time to the correct identity of an employee so that the flexibility of accounting can be improved.
- 3. Application scenario "Payment" Different scenarios in an organisation can require the need for secure, fast, and straightforward payment processes e.g. the payment of the cafeteria food shall be established in connection with the calculation of salaries or the copier has to be paid per original.
- 4. Application scenario "IT-log-on"

An electronic Employee ID Card can assist the holder in different electronic processes. Authentic or confidential sending of emails is only one example. This technical guideline focuses on the scenario of secure log on to computer systems.

The electronic Employee ID Card can be considered as a multi application card. If the provision of further applications in an organisation might be possible in the future this shall be considered already by the specification of the system solution.

The following sections provide more detailed information regarding the different application scenarios.

## <span id="page-142-0"></span>**9.1 Application scenario: "Access Control"**

### **Description**

By issuing an electronic Employee ID Card the organisation enables a specific employee to access the area of that organisation based on defined entitlements. The use of the carrier medium can be bounded to a single or distributed locations.

The application of access control is often connected to the application of time registration or payment.

### **Requirements**

An entitlement shall be designed in a flexible and modular way such that the access can be assignment according to the specific needs of the organisation.

Performance is a very important factor for the application of access control, since some application scenarios can be considered time-critical e.g. access to a parking lot. Access control with contactless carrier media must be reliable, fast, and secure.

If biometrics are used for the registration (with match-on-card or storage in a backend system) the electronic terminal has to be equipped with a biometric unit.

The storing and processing of personal data has to be performed in agreement with the working council or an assigned instance and the data protection official.

### **Commercial value/Threat of misuse**

The commercial value depends highly on the values that shall be protected by the access control. This can range from operating resources e.g. computer systems, arbitrary hardware, and stored data to industrial secrets. In case these values are lost or stolen the reputation or the advantage in competition can be threatened.

### **Application of the carrier medium**

In many cases a contactless chip card is issued that includes several different applications (e.g. compare section [9.2,](#page-143-0) [9.3](#page-144-0) or [9.4\)](#page-145-0) at the same time. An application can be assigned to one or several entitlements. Besides the electronic stored data visual features e.g. facial image and personal data such as name and job title are often important for the application scenario of access control.

The electronic Employee ID Card is assigned to an employee but is owned by the according organisation. Normally, the cards are in use for several years, therefore the cost of the carrier medium inclusive the calculated number of lost carrier media and the necessary further components (terminals, applications, and management systems) have to be balanced with the values that have to be protected.

Access control can be established for different scenario e.g. physical access to the area of the organisation, elevators, levels, or single rooms.

## <span id="page-143-0"></span>**9.2 Application scenario: "Time Registration"**

### **Description**

Modern time registration systems in an organisation are often based on complex accounting models since factors such that planning and administration have to be considered. An electronic Employee ID Card supports easy registration of start and end times as well as different types of work hours i.e. operative time, break, or overtime. A comprehensive system solution for time registration can support human resources.

The application of time registration is often connected with the application of access control and is therefore often based on already established processes. This can also mean that the same software application is used to provide services for access control and time registration.

The storing and processing of personal data has to be performed in agreement with the working council or an assigned instance and the data protection official.

#### **Requirements**

The organisation receives a tool that allows an easy and flexible planing of the human resources. If biometrics are used for the registration (with match-on-card or storage in a backend system) the electronic terminal has to be equipped with a biometric unit.

#### **Commercial value/Threat of misuse**

The possible damage can range from a single accounting error to the false accounting of all employee working hours. The misuse by passing an electronic Employee ID Card to a third person shall not be underestimated. Nevertheless, the transfer can be reduced if more than one application is supported by the carrier medium and the holder is responsible for misuse.

#### **Application of the carrier medium**

In many cases a contactless chip card is issued that includes several different applications (e.g. compare section [9.2,](#page-143-0) [9.3](#page-144-0) or [9.4\)](#page-145-0) at the same time. An application can be assigned to one or several entitlements. Often the time registration is performed at the entrance and exit of the organisation. Different requirements of an organisation can be realised with according software and hardware components.

The employee holds the carrier medium in the reading range of the electronic terminal and thereby starts the process of time registration. If applicable specific configurations can be performed at the electronic terminal e.g. entering of an additional PIN and selection of the working type.

For the application of time registration fallback solutions and exception handling e.g. temporarily no power for the electronic terminals have to be available.

## <span id="page-144-0"></span>**9.3 Application scenario: "Payment"**

### **Description**

Cashless payment can be used within an organisation to optimise processes since no change is necessary. In [\[FI08\]](#page-244-6) open and closed payment transaction systems are distinguished. While closed payment transaction systems include all cashless applications within a defined environment (e.g. an organisation) open systems are usually based on established standards such as ISO/IEC 14443 [\[ISO08b\]](#page-245-11) and are used between different instances. Furthermore two concepts for the accounting can be distinguished. A prepaid-system can be applied where a specific value of money is charged at a terminal on the carrier medium. During the payment process this value is decreased. The payment is performed anonymous. Another possibility is to charge a shadow account that can directly be accounted with the calculation of salaries. Thus, bonuses and monetary benefits can easily be calculated.

In this technical guideline closed payment systems within an organisation are considered as well as prepaid systems.

If an eID document is used within an organisation normally no data can be loaded on the underlying carrier medium. In this case an authentication has to be performed so that the payment can be connected to the according shadow account which is administrated in the backend system.

#### **Commercial value/Threat of misuse**

The commercial value is normally less than €100 since the payment is used in a cafeteria, parking lots, or kiosk where the items are comprehensive. Further applications comprise additional resources e.g. copier or gas stations.

By applying prepaid-systems the maximum loss of the commercial value depends on the maximum amount of money that can be loaded on the carrier medium electronically. If a shadow account system is used the maximum loss can be a lot higher. Therefore adequate security mechanisms and blocking mechanisms need to be considered.

The circle of users and visitors is restricted.

#### **Application of the carrier medium**

The electronic Employee ID Card is equipped with a payment application. If a service is only provided for members of an organisation specific entitlements can be assigned to the application (in the case of bonus programs).

Electronic terminals are made available for the charging process and to enable the employee to check the recent state of the payment application i.e. how much money is available at the identity card.

In case of payment the electronic Employee ID Card is brought in the reading range of the cashpoint and the respective amount is subtracted.

For the application of payment fallback solutions and exception handling e.g. temporarily no power for the electronic terminals have to be available.

## <span id="page-145-0"></span>**9.4 Application scenario: "IT-log-on"**

### **Description**

Besides physical access to the area of an organisation the storage, processing and handling of electronic data is of major concern. This can range from access to a local system to the access of distributed networks. As a consequence, authentication to a computer system is very important.

The application can be quite complex if Single-Sign-On (SSO) scenarios are considered because different alternatives are possible and are selected according to the requirements of an organisation. In this technical guideline the concept of SSO is not described any further.

#### **Requirements**

An electronic terminal has to be connected to the respective computer system. If biometrics are used for the registration (with match-on-card) the electronic terminal has to be equipped with a biometric unit.

#### **Commercial value/Threat of misuse**

The commercial value depends highly on the value of the electronic data that are stored on the computer system or can be accessed within the network. In general, the described data has to be considered of high value since it builds the know-how of the organisation and offers advantages in competition.

#### **Application of the carrier medium**

An electronic Employee ID Card can provide entitlements that can be used to log on to one or several hardware resources.

For the application of IT-log-on fallback solutions and exception handling e.g. temporarily no power for the electronic terminals have to be available.

# <span id="page-146-0"></span>**10 Recommendations for implementing the overall system**

In this section as an example an overall system regarding the application area "Electronic Employee ID Card" is described.

The overall system consist of the system infrastructure of an organisation and the carrier medium (here: electronic Employee ID Card) which are issued to the internal and external employees as well as to visitors. The system infrastructure is based on the individual requirements of the company or authority and thereby roles, processes and components with the connected interfaces have to be considered.

The solution which is presented in the following is based on the role model which was introduced in section [3.2,](#page-20-0) the processes in section [6,](#page-35-0) and the different application scenarios presented in section [9.](#page-141-0) The application area of an electronic Employee ID Card can be arbitrarily complex, since an organisation can chose between a number of applications an every application usually provides different properties from which an organisation can choose of. Thus, this technical guideline cannot describe every possible solution but tries to analyse the scenarios which are often applied. If necessary simplifications e.g. regarding the role model or other conditions within the system infrastructure are made this can lead to affects to other components within the system.

It is the focus of this technical guideline to sensibilise an organisation of the existing threats and identify the security requirements in particular of the handling of personal and usage data. Therefore at first, the protection demand categories are assigned for the overall system (compare section [10.1.1](#page-147-0) in particular table [62\)](#page-151-0) based on the afore introduced general description in section [8.2.5.](#page-78-1) Afterwards a relationship between the protection demand and the relevant threats is established.

*Note:* Within this scope the maximum principle applies which means that in case a threat occurs for several security targets the assigned protection demand is defined based on the highest protection result even though a single security target may require less protection demand. Based on the description of the relevant threats, the safeguards are described. Nevertheless, a lower protection level may be chosen for a safeguard under specific circumstances but shall be documented and motivated.

The following sections consider the overall solution while afterwards section [11](#page-175-0) will emphasise on the specific application scenarios.

## <span id="page-147-1"></span>**10.1 Recommendations of executing the infrastructure of the electronic Employee ID Card**

By considering the overall system in relation of the carrier medium the following issues will be addressed in more detail:

- **-** system infrastructure
- **-** interfaces
- **-** electronic terminals
- **-** applications and backend system (i.e. mainly the management system)
- **-** explicitly the key management and
- **-** the carrier medium.

In general, depending on the afore listed components the threats and counteracting safeguards are described and finally the derived residual risks are identified.

### <span id="page-147-0"></span>**10.1.1 Evaluation of the protection demand for the infrastructure of the electronic Employee ID Card**

For the application area "Electronic Employee ID Card" the following considerations shall be applied that have an influence on the evaluation of the protection demand regarding the infrastructure:

- 1. It is the objective of the system infrastructure (compare section [10.1\)](#page-147-1) to provide all different application scenarios at the same time. This means that the system architecture and the included components shall be able to be used in different contexts.
- 2. Personal data can either be stored on a carrier medium[14](#page-147-2) or within the management system. In any case the agreed data has to be managed and processed for the provision of individual services.
- 3. Usage data is accumulated by the processing of applications e.g. within the scope of registration. This data has to be analysed, communicated, and sent to the according receiver.

<span id="page-147-2"></span><sup>14</sup> This applies in particular if the system infrastructure is designed to support different backend systems.

Based on the criteria defined in section [8.2.5](#page-78-1) the infrastructure for the electronic Employee ID Card can be assigned to the following protection demand categories[15](#page-148-0):

### **10.1.2 Interfaces within the overall system**

The system which has been described in section [10.1](#page-147-1) relies on the interaction between all system components. In order to be able to provide the business processes which have been described in section [6,](#page-35-0) the technical interfaces and the operative interaction between the system components have to be specified.

Furthermore, agreements must be made between the entities to regulate the responsibilities and the operational procedures.

### **10.1.2.1 Threats relevant to the infrastructure of the electronic Employee ID Card**

Based on the security targets for the evaluation of the protection demand categories as described in section [10.1.1](#page-147-0) the following relevant threats can be identified for the interfaces:

*Table 65: Safeguards for the interfaces of the overall system*

### **10.1.2.3 Residual risks**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **10.1.3 Electronic terminals**

Electronic terminals control the flow of information for reading from and writing to the carrier medium, using a contactless communication protocol. The terminal (PCD as defined by ISO/IEC 14443) has the active role (master), while the carrier medium (PICC as defined by ISO/IEC 14443) is passive (slave).

Terminals are integrated into various system components:

- 1. Permanently installed terminals (i.e. close to doors or at a wall)
- 2. Personalisation/Enrolment PC
- 3. Desktop PC
- 4. Terminals that are used to charge the card for payment
- 5. Help desk
- 6. Mobile terminals that can be attached to desktop PCs.

The terminals shall provide the following properties:

- 1. Contactless read/write unit with interface as defined by ISO/IEC 14443 A/B Part 1-4
- 2. Connection to the management system. If an offline or semi-offline scenario is considered adequate interfaces for the update of blocking information need to be available.
- 3. Parallel support of several applications.
- 4. Provision of cryptographic functions e.g. to establish secure messaging or if applicable signing of data.
- 5. Secure key storage (SAM). Multiple SAM might be necessary for different applications.
- 6. Display for the visualisation of user feedback and error messages.
- 7. Adequate processing time dependent on the application.

### **10.1.3.1 Threats relevant to the electronic terminals**

Based on the preconditions for the evaluation of the protection demand categories (compare section [10.1.1\)](#page-147-0) the following relevant threats can be identified for the terminals:

*Table 68: Safeguards for the interfaces of the terminal*

### **10.1.3.3 Residual risks**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **10.1.4 Management System for the carrier medium including applications and the backend system**

For the application area "Electronic Employee ID Card" the management system builds a very important component because it comprises different subcomponents and works as a whole as counterpart to the carrier medium. A detailed overview of the structure of a management system for electronic Employee ID Cards has been presented in figure [1.](#page-13-1) Based on the chosen application scenario the "logic" of an application including the data that accompanies the processes can be moved in direction of the carrier medium or towards the management system. As an example the payment in the cafeteria might be connected to monetary benefits that are connected with the payroll accounting.

As a consequence, in order to satisfy the security considerations this technical guideline considers the comprehensive handling of personal data within the management system since in general user accounts are established in order to register and change the employee data and entitlements based on the respective situation (e.g. loss of electronic Employee ID Card, deregistration, or extension of entitlements).

### **10.1.4.1 Threats relevant to the management system**

Based on the preconditions for the evaluation of the protection demand categories (compare section [10.1.1\)](#page-147-0) the following relevant threats can be identified for the interfaces:

*Table 70: Safeguards for the management system*

### **10.1.4.3 Residual risks**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **10.1.5 Key management**

The objective of the key management is to provide keys in a safe and reliable way in the system, that are used by multiple entities, for all used carrier media, applications, and products. The key management is in the responsibility of the security manager. In general, [\[GSHB\]](#page-244-11) can be used as a guideline for implementation.

Keys are generated individual for each purpose. As far as possible, individual keys are assigned to the different forms of interactions (e.g. loading of application, assignment and reading of entitlements, definition of PINs). Specific properties have to be identified for every single application scenario within the scope of specification of a security concept that has to be in accordance with the role model.

The keys are generated in a secure environment and stored in a secure database. The various forms of SAM are also produced in this secure environment. The documentation of the life-cycle of the SAMs that are produced and issued is another of the key management system's tasks.

The SAMs and keys are generated by the security manager or his agents as and when users need them. The following types of SAMs are basically supported:

| Initialiser SAMs:          | Initialiser SAMs are required to initialise carrier media and load<br>applications.                                                                                        |  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Personaliser SAMs:         | Personaliser SAMs are required to load entitlements in the<br>appropriate applications.                                                                                    |  |
| Application Provider SAMs: | Application provider SAMs are required by the application<br>provider to read and activate entitlements, and in some cases to<br>send the sage data to the carrier medium. |  |

Key information is normally loaded onto a SAM when the user requires it. The objective of an initialiser is, for example to enable all of the carrier media that occur in its are to be initialised with the necessary applications without changing the SAM.

This kind of user-specific SAM must be configured under an agreement between the user of the SAM and the security manager.

The SAM shall support the secure loading of new keys via a network. Ideally, updating can be done by the security manager directly.

### **10.1.5.1 Threats relevant to the key management**

### **10.1.5.3 Residual risks**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## <span id="page-169-1"></span>**10.2 Recommendations of executing the carrier medium**

As described before there exist different kinds of secure tokens that can be used for authentication within an organisation. Here only carrier media that provide a contactless interface and can be used for visual check are considered as presented in table [73](#page-169-0) and [74.](#page-171-0)

<span id="page-170-0"></span><sup>17</sup> Due to privacy reasons it is not recommended to allow the unauthorised and plain exchange of (unique) information which is linked to the single carrier medium (like a UID) or linked to a single application or to a single group of users. Thereby, the possibilities to generate movement profiles by unauthorised parties gets more likely. It is recommended to use a random ID for selecting the carrier medium and to use an authentication with a secret key, followed by an encrypted communication, which guarantees confidentiality of the exchanged data, to retrieve the unique information of the carrier medium like the UID.

### **10.2.1 Initialisation of the carrier medium**

The initialisation of carrier media has been described by Process P3 in section [6.3](#page-37-1) as well as by the use case "Initialisation of the carrier medium" in section [7.4.](#page-49-0) Thereby, different methods for the realisation are possible:

- 1. Initialisation is performed by a special service provider. This is used in particular in cases where large number of chip cards are issued or if specific requirements for the initialisation are required.
- 2. Initialisation is performed by an assigned instance within the organisation.
- 3. Applications are provided by one or more application providers.

The respective procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation system in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the initialisation system.

For the use of governmental eID card the initialisation is considered mainly for the side of the management system (i.e. opening of user account). The initialisation of the eID card is not part of the initialisation process of the organisation.

### **10.2.2 Personalising the carrier medium**

The loading of entitlements into a carrier medium has been described by Process P3 in section [6.3](#page-37-1) as well as with the use cases described in sections [7.4](#page-49-0) and [7.7.](#page-53-0) There are different ways of realising this:

- 1. The entitlement is loaded directly during the initialisation by a special service provider. This is used particularly in cases where large numbers of chip cards are issued.
- 2. Entitlement loading is performed by an assigned instance within the organisation e.g. the application provider.
- 3. Entitlements are loaded onto existing applications and employee carrier media under the management of a specific terminal connected to the management system.

The respective procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation system in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the personalisation system.

For eID card the entitlements are loaded within the management system.

### **10.2.3 Evaluation of the protection demand of the carrier medium**

The determination of the relevant protection demand category is dependent on the application scenario, therefore, it will be examined in more detail in section [11.](#page-175-0)

*Table 75: Threats relevant to the carrier medium*

### **10.2.5 Definition of safeguards for the carrier medium**

The assignment of safeguards is dependent on the application scenario, therefore, it will be examined in more detail in section [11.](#page-175-0)

### **10.2.6 Residual risks**

The derivation of the residual risks is dependent on the application scenario, therefore, it will be examined in more detail in section [11.](#page-175-0)

# <span id="page-175-0"></span>**11 Recommendations for executing the productspecific application scenarios**

The following sections address in more detail the different application scenarios within the scope of the application area "Electronic Employee ID Card" which have been introduced in section [9.](#page-141-0)

Unlike other application areas the customer (here: the organisation) can choose between a large number of realisation alternatives. It is not possible in all cases to determine which alternative is the most significant one. In many cases the different options mean a shift of the logic in the direction to the carrier medium or the management system.

As a consequence, the following subsections can only represent selected application scenarios. Nevertheless, this technical guideline offers the main tools to determine the respective security considerations for the according application scenario.

*Note:* Within this scope the maximum principle applies which means that in case a threat occurs for several security targets the assigned protection demand is defined based on the highest protection result even though a single security target may require less protection demand. Based on the description of the relevant threats, the safeguards are described. Nevertheless, a lower protection level may be chosen for a safeguard under specific circumstances but shall be documented and motivated.

## **11.1 Application scenario "Access Control"**

The following considerations are based on the application scenario "Access Control" as introduced in section [9.1.](#page-142-0) Access control can be required for different scenarios: while a parking lot requires normally rather low protection the access to the building of an organisation would be considered higher and the access to a single room can be specified as even higher. In the following the access to a building is considered.

### **11.1.1 Evaluation of the protection demand categories**

For application scenario "Access Control" the following constraints shall be considered for the evaluation of the protection demand categories:

- 1. The commercial value that is to be protected is considered high.
- 2. Personal data is required in order to assign the entitlement for access but the action of entering the building is not logged depending on the person.
- 3. No usage data is required. The process consists mainly of opening a door.
- 4. No invoicing is required.
- 5. The entitlements are used multiple times (normally in accordance with the employment relationship). The carrier medium is carried around by the holder.
- 6. The combination with other application scenarios (e.g. time registration or payment), even with the same application scenario but with higher protection demand is possible. For the evaluation

of protection demand this aspect has to be considered because the other application scenario might have an even higher value.

Based on the criteria defined in section [8.2.5](#page-78-1) the following protection demand categories[19](#page-177-0) are assigned for the electronic Employee ID Card:

*Table 78: Use cases relevant to application scenario "Access Control"*

The following subsections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases.

### **11.1.3.1 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "Multi-application card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements for the application scenario "Access Control" are in general issued with a carrier medium of product type "multi-application card" or can be assigned to the use of an eID card. For multi-application cards the carrier medium is initialised with the application with one or more entitlements.

In most cases further applications from other application providers within the organisation are stored on the carrier medium. The security mechanisms of the chip usually enclose authentication, access control, and secure communication (compare section [10.2\)](#page-169-1).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is performed together with the personalisation of the entitlements at a service point with the responsibility of the security manager or an authorised instance.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [77.](#page-182-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 79: Safeguards for application scenario "Access Control" entitlement on a "multi-application card"*

### **11.1.3.2 Residual risks connected to the usage of "Multi-application cards"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.1.3.3 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "eID card"**

### Conditions particular to this case

By using an eID card for the application scenario "Access Control" the necessary entitlements are stored on the side of the management system since the eID card can usually not enclose further (additional) applications.

In general the eID application is used to authenticate the holder of the document but the communication partner has to provide specific certificates with the respective entitlements to request information from the eID holder.

The initialisation of the eID document is not performed within the organisation but is done already before.

If security mechanisms based on [\[EAC10\]](#page-244-1) are applied the holder of the eID card has to enter a secret PIN for the eID application (with respect to the PACE protocol).

*Table 80: Safeguards for application scenario "Access Control" entitlement on an "eID card"*

### **11.1.3.4 Residual risks connected to the usage of "eID cards"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **11.2 Application scenario "Time Registration"**

The following considerations are based on the application scenario "Time Registration" as introduced in section [9.2.](#page-143-0) Time registration can be required for accounting the working hours and supporting human resources. In the following the registration of working hours of employees are considered.

### **11.2.1 Evaluation of the protection demand categories**

For application scenario "Time Registration" the following constraints shall be considered for the evaluation of the protection demand categories:

- 1. The commercial value that is to be protected is based on the hourly rate of the organisation.
- 2. Personal data is required in order to assign the entitlement for the application of time registration to the according employee.
- 3. Usage data is required for the calculation of total working time, specific accounting models and so forth.
- 4. No invoicing is required.
- 5. The entitlements are used multiple times (normally in accordance with the employment relationship every working day). The carrier medium is carried around by the holder.
- 6. The combination with other application scenarios (e.g. access control or payment) is possible. For the evaluation of protection demand this aspect has to be considered because the other application scenario might have an even higher value.

Based on the criteria defined in section [8.2.5](#page-78-1) the following protection demand categories[21](#page-193-0) are assigned for the electronic Employee ID Card:

<span id="page-193-0"></span><sup>21</sup> A protection demand category can either be described as a requirement or by its impact.

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.2.3.3 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "Multi-application card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements for the application scenario "Time Registration" are often issued with a carrier medium of product type "multi-application card" or can be assigned in the management system in case an eID card is considered. The carrier medium is initialised with the application with one or more entitlements.

In most cases further applications from other application providers within the organisation are stored on the carrier medium. The security mechanisms of the chip usually enclose authentication, access control, and secure communication (compare section [10.2\)](#page-169-1).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is performed together with the personalisation of the entitlements at a service point with the responsibility of the security manager or an authorised instance.

### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [82.](#page-199-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 85: Safeguards for application scenario "Time Registration" entitlement on a "multi-application card"*

### **11.2.3.4 Residual risks connected to the usage of "Multi-application card"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.2.3.5 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "eID card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

By using an eID card for the application scenario "Time Registration" the necessary entitlements are stored on the side of the management system since the eID card can usually not enclose further (additional) applications.

In general the eID application is used to authenticate the holder of the document but the communication partner has to provide specific certificates with the respective entitlements to request information from the eID holder.

The initialisation of the eID document is not performed within the organisation but is done within the responsible municipality.

If security mechanisms based on [\[EAC10\]](#page-244-1) the holder of the eID card has to enter a secret PIN for the eID application (with respect to the PACE protocol).

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [82.](#page-199-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 86: Safeguards for application scenario "Time Registration" entitlement on an "eID card"*

### **11.2.3.6 Residual risks connected to the usage of "eID card"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **11.3 Application scenario "Payment"**

The following considerations are based on the application scenario "Payment" as introduced in section [9.3.](#page-144-0) Payment can be required for different scenarios: for the cafeterias and kiosk that are located within an organisation but also for further services that have to be paid e.g. the use of a gas station in an organisation. The organisation can choose between a great number of options such as prepaid scenarios or scenarios which support a shadow account that again can be combined with a large number of properties. In the following a closed scenario that is based on a prepaid system is considered.

### **11.3.1 Evaluation of the protection demand categories**

For application scenario "Payment" the following constraints shall be considered for the evaluation of the protection demand categories:

- 1. The commercial value that is to be protected is considered as the maximum value that can be loaded.
- 2. No personal data is required in order to assign the entitlement for payment in a prepaid scenario.
- 3. Usage data is required, because the available units of value must be known.
- 4. No invoicing is required (for a prepaid scenario).
- 5. The entitlements are used multiple times. The carrier medium is carried around by the holder.
- 6. The combination with other application scenarios (e.g. access or time registration), even with the same application scenario but with higher protection demand is possible. For the evaluation of protection demand this aspect has to be considered because the other application scenario might have an even higher value.

Based on the criteria defined in section [8.2.5](#page-78-1) the following protection demand categories[22](#page-217-0) are assigned for the electronic Employee ID Card:

<span id="page-217-0"></span><sup>22</sup> A protection demand category can either be described as a requirement or by its impact.

*Table 89: Use cases relevant to application scenario "Payment"*

### **11.3.3.1 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "Multi-application card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements for the application scenario "Payment" are in general issued with a carrier medium of product type "multi-application card". The carrier medium is initialised with the application with one or ore entitlements.

In most cases further applications from other application providers within the organisation are stored on the carrier medium. The security mechanisms of the chip usually enclose authentication, access control, and secure communication (compare section [10.2\)](#page-169-1).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is performed together with the personalisation of the entitlements at a service point with the responsibility of the security manager or an authorised instance.

The carrier medium is charged at specific terminals (cash machines) and can be used at other specific terminals (cash desks) in order to pay.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [88.](#page-222-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 90: Safeguards for application scenario "Payment" entitlement on a "multi-application card"*

### **11.3.3.2 Residual risks connected to the usage of "Multi-application card"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **11.4 Application scenario "IT-log-on"**

The following considerations are based on the application scenario "IT-log-on" as introduced in section [9.4.](#page-145-0) IT-log-on can be required for different scenarios: log on to an individual PC, a network, or further resources. Therefore the security level is highly dependent on the selected scenario. In the following the log on to an individual PC is considered.

### **11.4.1 Evaluation of the protection demand categories**

For application scenario "IT-log-on" the following constraints shall be considered for the evaluation of the protection demand categories:

- 1. The commercial value that is to be protected is based on the stored data on the PC.
- 2. Personal data is required in order to assign the entitlement for the application of IT-log-on to the according employee.
- 3. Usage data is not required for simple log on.
- 4. No invoicing is required.
- 5. The entitlements are used multiple times (normally in accordance with the employment relationship). The carrier medium is carried around by the holder.
- 6. The combination with other application scenarios (e.g. access control or payment) is possible. For the evaluation of protection demand this aspect has to be considered because the other application scenario might have an even higher value.

Based on the criteria defined in section [8.2.5](#page-78-1) the following protection demand categories[23](#page-228-0) are assigned for the electronic Employee ID Card:

|---------------------------------------|

*Table 93: Use cases relevant to application scenario "IT-log-on"*

### **11.4.3.1 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "Multi-application card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements for the application scenario "IT-log-on" are in general issued with a carrier medium of product type "multi-application card". The carrier medium is initialised with the application with one or more entitlements.

In most cases further applications from other application providers within the organisation are stored on the carrier medium. The security mechanisms of the chip usually enclose authentication, access control, and secure communication (compare section [10.2\)](#page-169-1).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is performed together with the personalisation of the entitlements at a service point with the responsibility of the security manager or an authorised instance.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [92.](#page-233-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 94: Safeguards for application scenario "IT-log-on" entitlement on a "multi-application card"*

### **11.4.3.2 Residual risks connected to the usage of "Multi-application card"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.4.3.3 Safeguards for the usage of the carrier medium "eID card"**

#### Conditions particular to this case

By using an eID card for the application scenario "IT-log-on" the necessary entitlements are stored on the side of the management system since the eID card can usually not enclose further (additional) applications.

Note: So far the application scenario "IT-log-on" has not been realised with an eID card. In general, with adjustments on the side of the IT resource to which a log on shall be performed the application might be realised by the use of the eID application.

In general the eID application is used to authenticate the holder of the document but the communication partner has to provide specific certificates with the respective entitlements to request information from the eID holder.

The initialisation of the eID document is not performed within the organisation but is done within the responsible municipality.

If security mechanisms based on [\[EAC10\]](#page-244-1) the holder of the eID card has to enter a secret PIN for the eID application (with respect to the PACE protocol).

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in table [92.](#page-233-0) These safeguards are described in section [8.4.](#page-91-1)

*Table 95: Safeguard for application scenario "IT-log-on" entitlement on an "eID card"*

### **11.4.3.4 Residual risks connected to the usage of "eID card"**

Due to technical or commercial reasons it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely by applying safeguards. In any case some residual risks remain. A cost-benefit analysis can give information which safeguard shall be applied.

The residual risk shall be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.
