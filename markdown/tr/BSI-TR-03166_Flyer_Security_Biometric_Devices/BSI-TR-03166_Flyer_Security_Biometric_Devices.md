# *Certified Security for Biometric Devices*

### *Our vision:*

## *Biometrics as secure as a 6-digit PIN*

*Biometrics is by far the most popular method of authentication in numerous IT-security applications with rapidly increasing demands for security and reliability.*

*Compared to PINs, passwords or physical security tokens biometric authentication is fast and user friendly. But, is biometrics sufficiently secure?*

*To answer this question the BSI developed the Technical Guideline BSI TR-03166 for the certification of biometric device systems.*

*For security the customer wants and the application needs.*

Assessing the security of biometric devices is challenging, including performance, presentation attacks and organisatorial measures.

Numerous different standards and nomenclatures make it difficult for manufacturers and users to keep track.

#### **Ingredients for a BSI Biometric Security Standard**
