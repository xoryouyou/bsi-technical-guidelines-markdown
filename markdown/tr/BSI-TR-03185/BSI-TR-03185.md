## <span id="page-5-0"></span>1 Introduction

Secure software and hardware form the basis for the secure use of IT products in government, business and society. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) therefore appeals to manufacturers to consider information security from the outset and to make it as easy as possible for users to use their products securely through secure pre-configuration.

Against this backdrop, this Technical Guideline (TG) was created in accordance with the requirements of the BSI IT-Grundschutz (IT basic protection) for secure software development processes, supplemented by the respective norms, standards and frameworks. The focus here was on the potential enhancement and structuring.

The European Union is also implementing the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) to focus current legislation on the cybersecurity of IT products throughout their entire life cycle, thus placing manufacturers under an obligation to conduct the appropriate risk assessments and to maintain an adequate level of information security.

### **Objective**

This Technical Guideline

- lists and groups the requirements from existing norms and standards
- provides an introduction to the topic of a secure software lifecycle
- specifies the relevant requirements in the context of information security
- provides the opportunity to evaluate and improve in-house development processes in terms of information security.

This Technical Guideline considers

- the processes in the context of software development and
- the resources and tools used.

In its current version, the TG in its entirety does not apply to processes for developing software that are generally referred to as "Open Source Software (OSS)" or "free / libre and open source software (FLOSS / FOSS)". Requirements that demand a specific consideration of the features of open source software development must be adapted for such applications.

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>2 Structure of the TG

This chapter first outlines the TG system and the terms used within it. This is followed by the potential perspectives of the software user (Chapter 3.1) and the software producer (Chapter 3.2).

### <span id="page-6-0"></span>2.1 Definition of terms

### **Manufacturer**

"Manufacturer" in the document refers to a natural or legal person who (regardless of the organisational form or of the process model used) is responsible for producing software, i.e. developing, creating, delivering/providing and supporting such software.

### **Perspectives**

The perspective from which a manufacturer operates in the software lifecycle may vary. In the document, the manufacturer's perspectives are divided as follows:

- Software **user** This includes processes, activities and requirements of the **software (tools) used** for production.
- Software **producer**

This refers to processes, activities and requirements for the **software to be produced.** This perspective includes that of the "software user" at all times.

### **Software lifecycle**

This TG refers to the software creation processes on the manufacturer side, from the perspective of software users and software producers (see below).

The process of defining requirements for the software to be created is not considered here. It is assumed that the relevant information security requirements are available or submitted to the manufacturer as a software producer.

### **Processes and requirements**

Processes summarise the actions required to fulfil or implement the requirements for a secure software lifecycle and can be assigned to the perspectives.

Processes relating to the "software user" perspective:

- Project management
- Documentation
- Testing and release
- Installation
- Patch and change management and
- decommissioning.

Processes for the "software producer":

- Project management
- Documentation
- Development
- Testing and release
- Delivery
- Vulnerability management and
- decommissioning.

### <span id="page-7-0"></span>2.2 Notes and explanations

#### **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**

The information security issue relating to the provision of IT and infrastructure as a (supporting) task by the manufacturer should be taken into account within the framework of an information security concept or ISMS (e.g. pursuant to the BSI IT-Grundschutz). It does not form part of this TG.

In the context of an ISMS, terms such as protection needs, security profile, trusted source are also used in this document and are assigned a specific meaning.

#### **Project planning**

The document focuses in particular on aspects of information security and does not constitute a guide for the planning of software projects.

Similarly, the order of the processes and requirements indicated here does not represent a mandatory chronological sequence for a software project.

#### **Process model**

The TG does not require a specific process model for software development, as the processes and methods described here are so generic that they can be adapted to the process model selected in the individual case (e.g. traditionally sequential or agile).

#### **Modal verbs**

In the requirements, the modal verbs "SHOULD" and "MUST" written in capital letters are used in their respective forms and the respective negations to make clear how the respective verbs should be interpreted. The definitions used here are based on [RFC2119] and DIN 820-2:2012, Annexe H [820-2].

| MUST:       | This term means that this is a requirement that must be imperatively<br>fulfilled (absolute requirement).                                                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MUST NOT:   | This term means that something must not be done in no case (absolute<br>prohibition).                                                                                                       |
| SHOULD:     | This term means that a requirement usually must be fulfilled, but that there<br>can be reasons to not fulfil the requirement. However, this must be carefully<br>assessed and well founded. |
| SHOULD NOT: | This term means that something should not be done usually, but that there<br>can be reasons to do it. However, this must be carefully assessed and well<br>founded.                         |
| MAY:        | This expression denotes a requirement that is optional. The requirements<br>indicated in the document should be considered as examples.                                                     |

## <span id="page-9-2"></span>3 Requirements on the part of the manufacturer

The following chapters list the requirements on the part of the software manufacturer. These were compiled from various norms, standards and frameworks with reference to the BSI IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium, so the requirements may therefore exhibit different language styles and levels of detail.

All the requirements in the following two chapters (perspectives) are relevant for manufacturers. This arises from the assumption that it is not possible to produce software without IT support. The potential extent of tool support may vary greatly.

The sources used are referenced in the requirements listed for further information. The basis for this:

- BSI IT-Grundschutz-Kompendium 2023
- NESAS, FS.16, Version 2.3
- DIN EN IEC 62443-4-1:2018-10
- NIST SP 800-218, Version 1.1, February 2022

In addition to the source information, further information on the requirements is available based on the following system:

| Additional information | Sources of further information                      |
| Keywords               | Important terms used in the text of the requirement |
| Glossary               | Terms explained in the glossary                     |

### <span id="page-9-1"></span>3.1 Requirements for the manufacturer as a user of software

This chapter lists the requirements for the manufacturer from the perspective of a software user. This specifically refers to tools that support the software lifecycle (e.g. for project management, documentation, development, testing, CI/CD), which are used in particular in the processes described in Chapter 3.2.

The requirements are broken down into:

- Project management (General, acquisition, IT operations and personnel)
- Documentation
- Testing and release
- Installation
- Patch and change management and
- <span id="page-9-0"></span>Decommissioning.

### 3.1.1 Project management

Project management is essential for the use of tools to support the software lifecycle. Aspects of information security should also be noted here. The relevant requirements are divided into the sub-areas: general, acquisition, IT operations and personnel.

### 3.1.1.1 General

General considerations regarding the definition of the requirements for the software tools form the basis for the further process regarding the use of tools. The relevant requirements are listed below.

## <span id="page-19-0"></span>3.2 Requirements for the manufacturer as a software producer

This chapter sets out the obligations to the manufacturer from the perspective of a producer of software.

The chapter is divided into the following topics

- Project management (general, personnel)
- Documentation (project documentation, user documentation)
- Development (development management, design, threat modelling, design/architecture, design review, in-development testing, third-party components, code management, tools, inventory)
- Testing and release (patches and updates)
- Delivery
- Vulnerability management and
- decommissioning.

**NOTE**: The process of defining requirements for the software to be created is not currently considered here. It is assumed that the relevant information security requirements are currently available or are being provided.

### <span id="page-20-0"></span>3.2.1 Project management

Information security aspects are vitally important when planning software development. The focus for the manufacturer is therefore on the requirements for the product, the company's organisation, the processes and, where applicable, the manufacturer's technical infrastructure.

### 3.2.1.1 General

The following sets out the general aspects of software development and requirements regarding information security.

### <span id="page-23-0"></span>3.2.2 Documentation

The documentation to be maintained in a (development) project may be divided into project documentation and user documentation. The project documentation should contain all the elements that enable the traceability of decisions and the evidence of results in the project (software creation).

This must be distinguished from the user documentation, which contains all the important information about the software for future users.

The following two tables list the requirements in these two areas.

### <span id="page-35-0"></span>3.2.6 Vulnerability management

Bugs may appear in (software) products that cause security problems arising from vulnerabilities.

Solutions (e.g. patches/updates) must be provided promptly if security-critical vulnerabilities are identified in the software developed in-house.

If solutions to security-critical vulnerabilities in third-party components are provided by the manufacturers/creators of such, it may be necessary to adapt the software developed in-house accordingly and made available as a solution in a timely manner.

This describes requirements for addressing security-related issues in a product.
