## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**1 Introduction**

## <span id="page-4-1"></span>**1.1 Purpose**

Trust services, as specified in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 **[eIDAS]** (short: eIDAS), shall give participants of electronic commerce confidence in the security of these trust services. This confidence is expected to result from a set of procedures, processes and security measures, the Trust Service Provider (TSP) has established in order to minimize the operational and financial threats and risks associated.

eIDAS distinguishes two trust levels with respect to trust services and providers of trust services:

- normal trust services and trust service providers (TSP) and
- **qualified** trust services and trust service providers (**QTSPs**) that need to fulfil additional legal requirements and are subject to periodical independent third party conformity assessments by accredited conformity assessment bodies (CAB).

### (Q)TSP means TSP or QTSP.

Especially **qualified** trust services and QTSPs will fulfil such high expectations of participants.

**[ETSI TS 119 511]** defines policy requirements for operation and management practices of a TSP, which provides long-term preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature techniques. **[ETSI TS 119 511]** does not specify **how** the requirements can be assessed by an independent party and what kind of information and documents shall be the subject of such a conformity assessment. **[ETSI TS 119 511]** refers to **[ETSI EN 319 403]** "Requirements for Conformity Assessment Bodies Assessing Trust Service Providers", which is applicable to CABs and which supplements the international standard **[ISO/IEC 17065]**, which accredited CABs must fulfil. **[ETSI EN 319 403]** poses general requirements on CABs assessing (qualified) trust services and does neither distinguish between different trust services nor define dedicated assessment criteria for the application of standards like **[ETSI EN 319 401]** or standards for dedicated trust services of the ETSI EN 319 4x1 series.

More specifically, **[ETSI TS 119 511]** extends the general requirements of **[ETSI 319 401]** for a TSP, which provides long-term preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature techniques.

If the **[ETSI EN 319 401]** defines general requirements on the TSP's public documentation, including the TSP's management and operation, the **[ETSI TS 119 511]** defines specific requirements to documentation and policies relating to the preservation service (e.g. Preservation Service Practice Statement, Preservation Evidence Policy, etc.) including technical and operational requirements relating to the preservation service (e.g. Preservation

Profiles, Preservation Protocol, Notification Protocol, etc.).

Assessment criteria, derived one-by-one from **[ETSI TS 119 511]** requirements, are neither intended nor included.

In summary, neither the TSP specific standards (ETSI EN 319 4x1) nor the CAB specific standard **[ETSI EN 319 403]** provides dedicated assessment criteria for an application for the conformity assessment of TSP.

The document **[ASS 319 401],** further on also called Part 1, has the goal to bridge this gap with respect to **[ETSI EN 319 401]**.

The present document, further on also called Part 2 and referenced by **[Ass 119 511]**, has the goal to bridge this gap with respect to **[ETSI TS 119 511]**. It specifies assessment criteria to be used by accredited conformity assessment bodies (CAB) to assess the conformity of (qualified) trust service providers ((Q)TSPs) against the standard **[ETSI TS 119 511]**.

The conformity assessment of Part 1 SHALL be performed before the conformity assessment of Part 2 or in parallel.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>**2 Scope of Document**

These assessment criteria are the module for conformity assessment of TSPs that fulfils the requirements of **[ETSI TS 119 511]**. Other modules, applicable for the conformity assessment of TSP with specific other trust services may be drafted in the future. The assessment criteria are directly derived from the policy requirements given by **[ETSI TS 119 511]**. CAB shall apply all criteria set out in **[ETSI TS 119 511]** to be conformant to this document.

There exist further parts of assessment criteria based on **[ETSI EN 319 401]** and beside **[ETSI TS 119 511]** for other specific trust services. Such assessment criteria will always be additional to those set out in Part 1 and Part 2. Currently, e.g. the following norms and specifications are available to specific types of (qualified) trust services as defined in **[eIDAS]**:

| Type of (Qualified) Trust Service                                                   | Related Norms and Technical<br>Specifications        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| creation of qualified certificates for electronic<br>signatures or electronic seals | ETSI EN 319 411-2 together with ETSI EN<br>319 411-1 |
| creation of qualified certificates for web site<br>authentication                   | ETSI EN 319 411-2 together with ETSI EN<br>319 411-1 |
| creation of qualified electronic time stamps                                        | ETSI EN 319 421                                      |
| validation of qualified electronic signature and<br>seals                           | ETSI TS 119 441                                      |
| electronic registered delivery                                                      | ETSI EN 319 521 and<br>ETSI EN 319 531               |
| signing service                                                                     | ETSI TS 119 431-1 and ETSI TS 119 431-<br>2          |
| preservation service                                                                | ETSI TS 119 511 and ETSI TS 119 512                  |

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>**Table 1 Types of (qualified) Trust Services**

**Not** addressed in this document are organisational activities of the CAB and its assessors like contract gathering aspects and project management, assessor qualification and audit planning, reporting specific aspects or non-conformity tracking. These aspects are in the scope of **[ISO/IEC 17065]** and **[ETSI EN 319 403]** which are normative to the CAB.

There are also **not** addressed requirements of **[ETSI EN 319 401]**, which is the base and a prerequisite of an assessment of a (qualified) TSP. This document relates to the specific assessment criteria for a TSP providing long-term preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature techniques.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2.1 Assessment Framework**

Derived assessment criteria are embedded in the European regulatory framework. On EUlevel, each TSP underlies especially the eIDAS regulation **[eIDAS]** and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) shall comply also with **[EU regulation 765/2008]**. Furthermore, EU implementing acts and national trust service laws apply to both. The ETSI series related to trusted services apply to TSPs in the same way, as related ISO and ETSI norms and standards or specifications apply to CABs. The following figure sketches hierarchy of documented regulatory framework and shows the relation to a Preservation Service Provider (as an example of a TSP) and a CAB as acting entities. The assessment criteria are applicable to CAB only.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>**Figure 1: ETSI Assessment Framework**

**[ETSI EN 319 401]**specifies general policy requirements on the operation and management practices of a TSP regardless of the service the TSP provides.

Subordinated **[ETSI EN 319 411-1]** or **[ETSI TS 119 511]** specify specific policy requirements, depending on the specific service of the TSP. So, other than **[ETSI EN 319 401]**, only those norms and specifications from ETSI series apply, which are required for the specific type of trust service. As an example, **[ETSI EN 319 411-1]** applies to TSPs issuing certificates for natural or legal persons. In the same way, **[ETSI TS 119 511]** applies to Preservation Service Providers.

The regulatory framework for CABs is based on **[ISO/IEC 17065]** as an accreditation norm, amended by **[ETSI EN 319 403]**.

The assessment requirements are then based on the standards, so that the Preservation TSP has to be conformant with **[ETSI EN 319 401]** and **[ETSI TS 119 511]**, providing longterm preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature techniques.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**2.2 Document Overview**

The following **chapter 3** specifies the assessment approach. It gives the frame for applying the criteria found in the following chapters.

In **chapter 4,** the present document describes the structure and explains the content of the tables, which contain norm requirements together with detailed assessment criteria. The last column provides space to fill in observations, verdicts and findings, as a result of an assessment.

Subsequent **chapters 5 to 7** define the assessment criteria for conformity assessment against **[ETSI TS 119 511]**, following its document structure.

The assessment criteria are written in such a way that the present document (or the respective parts of it) could be used as **template** for the documentation of the results of a conformity assessment. An utilisation of the tables within a spreadsheet might be helpful for an actual assessment.

## <span id="page-9-0"></span>**3 Assessment Approach**

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>**3.1 Assessment Pre-Requisites**

For demonstrating conformance to **[ETSI TS 119 511]** all mandatory assessment criteria in this document shall be applied.

Pre-requisites for such a conformance assessment are the following aspects:

- Because **[ETSI TS 119 511]** extends **[ETSI EN 319 401]**, it is necessary for the CAB to **assess** the assessment criteria of **[ETSI EN 319 401]** (usually during the **[ETSI TS 119 511]** assessment, but also possibly beforehand).
- Due to the public nature of the provided preservation services, the Preservation Service Provider (PSP) has to **document** its implementing practices, together with legal terms and conditions. These documents target public audiences, who can be any party relying on the provided preservation services. With those documents, the PSP shows, what and how it is doing to fulfil the applicable norm requirements, here of **[ETSI TS 119 511]**.
- The TSP has to **implement** all preservation service practices laid down in its publicly**[1](#page-9-4)** available documents. Clearly, its implementation must fully conform to its own public documents.

The CAB will assess the TSP as an organisation with its documentation and its implemented preservation services, based on the assessment criteria from the present document. The main task of the assessor is to determine if all mandatory assessment criteria are fulfilled. In this case conformance to **[ETSI TS 119 511]** is implied.

Before starting a conformity assessment a contract between the accredited CAB and the PSP needs to be established. Further pre-requisites on the assessment process result from the accreditation of the CAB against **[ISO/IEC 17065]** and **[ETSI EN 319 403]** (e.g. audit team, assessment plan). They are out of scope of the present document, which focusses on the assessment activities itself and – in detail – on the expected results.

## <span id="page-9-2"></span>**3.2 Strictness of Assessment Criteria**

For a better understanding of the strictness of the assessment criteria within this document it is necessary to clearly separate between the two different types of rules to be followed:

- "Requirements" are applicable to TSPs/PSPs and directly originate from the related ETSI documents (**ETSI EN 319 401**, **[ETSI TS 119 511],** etc.).
- The assessment "criteria" are applicable to the CAB and its assessors and mainly derived from those ETSI documents applicable to TSPs/PSPs.

## <span id="page-9-3"></span>**3.2.1 Requirements**

Requirements from TSP/PSP related ETSI documents use the modal verbs terminology of ETSI Drafting Rules, clause 3.2 (Verbal forms for the expression of provisions): "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "may", "need not", "will", "will not", "can" and "cannot".

Whenever the assessor identifies a "shall" requirement not being fulfilled by a TSP, a **non-**

<span id="page-9-4"></span> <sup>1</sup> Mandatory public documents of the PSP are its PSPS and terms & conditions.

**conformity (NC)** results. Such a NC may result in a stop of business for the TSP/PSP. Any decision about the severeness of non-conformities is up to the CAB, the assessor is working for and resides outside the scope of this document. Likewise, if a "should" requirement is unfulfilled by a TSP, a **recommendation (R)** results and further assessment activities by the CAB are necessary.

A "should" requires from the TSP either to fulfil the requirement exactly as it is specified or respective test material or explanations should demonstrate the specified behaviour to make evident that it`s equivalent to the requirements and to the required security levels. Remark: not related to the strictness are so called **potentials for improvement (PI),** an assessor may identify. These PIs are only informative to the TSP.

### <span id="page-10-0"></span>**3.2.2 Assessment Criteria**

Regarding the assessment criteria, this document uses the following three major classes of assessment criteria (cf. [RFC 2119])

- MAY: These criteria are just hints or optional activities of the assessor. These criteria will not result in mandatory assessment activities.
- SHOULD: These criteria are strong recommendations. Respective assessment activities should be performed by the assessor. Alternatively, the assessor explains why he or she uses a different approach and why this activity assures the same assessment result as the original activity.
- SHALL (or synonymously MUST): These are strict criteria. It is not allowed to use different assessment activities.

The strictness of the assessment criteria applicable to the CAB and its assessors is to be specified by the applicable accreditation and certification scheme and resides outside the scope of this document.

## <span id="page-10-1"></span>**3.3 Structure of the Assessment Criteria**

The order of the assessment criteria follows the document structure (chapters, sections) of norm **[ETSI TS 119 511]**. For each individual norm requirement, assessment criteria are derived for either stage 1 document assessment or/and stage 2 on-site assessment, as applicable. A conformant design of the provided preservation services, laid-out in the PSP documents (stage 1), is a pre-requisite for starting to audit the actual implementation on-site (stage 2).

Norm chapters address specific aspects, a (Q)PSP and/or its preservation service(s) need to fulfil. Such aspects range

• from sole **document** related requirements, which the documents of a (Q)PSP need to conform with;

- through requirements related to **organisational** structure and processes and its procedures;
- down to **infrastructural** requirements, both physical and logical (i.e. building infrastructure and IT infrastructure).

Such a broad range of aspects is due to the overarching nature of "policy" requirements. A reason for such an approach are current **information security management practices.** To handle security, the purpose of business and applied processes need to be understood. Then immanent risks in the type of business and processes (to be implemented) need to be identified and treated assuring an acceptable level of security. Such treatment is structured along security measures. There are four generic types of **security measures:**

- **Physical** security measures,
- **Organisational** security measures,
- **Personnel** related security measures, and
- **Technology** related security measures.

In a similar way, all assessment criteria are related to both, **functional and security aspects,** often at the same time and regardless of being related to (Q)TSP documentation and/or to actual implementation of provided trust service(s). The basic nature of trust services is trust, so functional aspects like the generation of certificates or signatures are actually security functions, using cryptography and implementing security objectives as integrity, confidentiality or authenticity. A sharp distinction between functional and security aspects is, therefore, at least difficult, if not impossible. The assessment must consider functional and security aspects always at the same time.

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>**3.4 Assessment Stages and Assessor Activities**

The **assessment** of a (Q)TSP/(Q)PSP is performed by an accredited CAB on the basis of **[EN 319 403]** and split into two stages (see also **[ETSI EN 319 403]**):

- **Stage 1** Document Assessment: the CAB assesses the documentation of the (Q)TSP for conformance with the requirements laid out in the applicable ETSI standard(s);
- **Stage 2** On Site Assessment**[2](#page-11-1)** (Audit): the CAB assesses the (Q)TSP management, organisation, processes, documentation, facilities and infrastructures on site, i.e. at the (Q)TSP premises, for conformance with the requirements laid out in the applicable ETSI standard(s).

At each stage, the CAB assessment includes **analytic, conclusive and reporting activities.** So the CAB assessor will

- analyse documents,
- ask questions and perform interviews,
- inspect and has an eye on-site.

<span id="page-11-1"></span> <sup>2</sup> Pre-assessment condition: see **[EN 319 403]**, chapter 7.4.5.3: In every case, the document review (stage 1) shall be completed prior to the commencement of audit, stage 2.

Based on this the assessor:

- wants to understand the organisation and its services,
- identifies potential gaps or non-conformities,
- concludes whether the (Q)TSP/(Q)PSP fulfils its requirements, and finally
- prepares a report on its findings and observations.

The assessment criteria require from the assessor to perform certain activities and to check the expected results, with respect to the requirements. Per stage, the assessor describes the observations during his or her activity and gives per criterion a verdict (either "OK" or "not OK"). Also, he or she includes (negative) findings, expressed as non-conformities, recommendations or potentials for improvement.

The assessor must document all results of assessor activities. For this the tables in chapter 5 to 7 SHOULD be used as a template for logging. Finally, an assessment report SHALL be written. See **[ETSI TS 119 403-3]** for details.

### <span id="page-12-0"></span>**3.4.1 Usage of a Certified TR-ESOR (V1.2.1 or later) Product in Combination with a Preservation Service Provider (PSP)**

If the PSP claims to use a certified **TR-ESOR product [TR-ESOR] of version V1.2.1 or higher** and the claimed **[TR-ESOR]** certified product is in fact deployed for providing this service, proved e.g. by comparing the digital fingerprint of relevant executables, then the assessment result of the equivalent **[ETSI TS 119 511]** - test case is substituted by the TR-ESOR-certification result and this **[ETSI TS 119 511]** - assessment test step SHALL be omitted.

### <span id="page-12-1"></span>**3.4.2 Identification of Assessment Criteria**

Each assessment criterion relates to a norm requirement identified by its unique identifier:

<the 3 letters REQ> - < the clause number> - <2 digit number - incremental>

Specific criterions are splitted into documentation related (stage 1) and implementation related aspects (stage 2, audit). Normally, stage 2 related criteria base on the results of stage 1 assessment. Some aspects are only relevant for stage 1, like some detailed content of the terms and conditions. Those will **not** be addressed in stage 2. Nevertheless, most aspects from stage 1 need to be mirrored and/or inspected on-site during stage 2.

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>**4 Structure of Assessment Criteria and Report Template**

The following figure describes the structure and content of the tables used for assessment criteria as contained in chapter 5 to 7. The tables could be utilised as a template for a reporting of the assessment, as well. For that purpose, the use of a customised spreadsheet is advisable.

![](_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-13-1"></span>**Figure 2: Structure of Assessment Criteria and Report Template**

Notes and auditor guidance may origin from the norm itself or may be additional to that.

If it is quoted from norm, the text in the table is set in *slanted* format.

The content of the column "Notes/auditor/Guidance" in the [Figure 2: "Structure of](#page-13-1)  [Assessment Criteria and Report Template"](#page-13-1) is informative.

Assessment criteria request assessor activities per each TSP requirement. Usually, the criteria text starts with a standard sentence and is followed by the specific assessor activities (indicated by hyphens "-"), and – in case – further detailed (indicated by plus signs "+"). Example **OVR-6.4-01**:

#### "See **[ASS 119 511]**, **OVR-6.1-03**.

*The assessor shall check if the PSP* 

- has *supported at least one preservation profile pursuant to OVR-6.2-03* 

*or* 

- *stated which [TR-ESOR] certified product of version 1.2.1 or higher is used for providing the service and this requirement by this PSP"*

## **10 Assessment criteria for Annex A (normative): Qualified preservation service for QES as defined by article 34 the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014**

*NOTE 1: This clause aims at providing requirements for a preservation service allowing it to fulfil the requirement of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signature and or seals (QES)* 

*NOTE 2: A qualified preservation service is only mentioned for the preservation of QES, not for the preservation of general data. However, nothing forbids such a service to preserve also other data.*
