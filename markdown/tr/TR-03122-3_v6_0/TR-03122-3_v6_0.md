### *Expected Result:*

The resulting plot should be close to a linear function.

A linear regression is performed over the value pairs (integration time, average grey value),(luminance, average value) or (reflectance, value). The dif ference between the average grey value and the grey value from regression is calculated for each measurement.

None of the calculated differences SHALL exceed 7.65 grey levels.

### *Description:*

The target is placed on the scanner platen and images are taken with the lines of the Ronchi pattern parallel to pixel columns (vertical bars) and rows (ho rizontal bars) of the image sensor, respectively. A flexible target has to be pres sed against the scanner platen to make sure the target is in contact with the platen over the entire pattern area. If the target pattern covers less than 25% of the scanners capture area, the procedure is applied to the right and the left half of the capture area, respectively. The bars Ronchi patterns have to be ali gned with the pixel rows and columns to an angle less than 0.5Â°. If the images from the scanner are inverted they have to be back show dark pat terns on a bright background.

#### *Expected Result:*

Set of images with the bars Ronchi pattern in vertical and horizontal di rection, showing dark patterns on a bright background.

*Description:*

The resulting images files are converted to TIFF format and are processed with the tool WinMTF. This program determines the modulation in each of the Ronchi test patterns. These modulation values are absolute with respect to the dynamic range of the image and do not represent the [contrast transfer func](#page-163-3) [tion \(CTF\)](#page-163-3).

*Expected Result:*

Absolute modulation values for each of the Ronchi patterns on the test chart.

### *Description:*

The absolute modulation values have to be normalized by the modulation of the large black and white patches on test chart, representing a spatial fre quency of approximately zero cycles per millimetre. The average grey level in the black and white patches is calculated and the modulation is calculated as

$$\text{followes: } M\_0 = \frac{G\_{white} - G\_{black}}{G\_{white} + G\_{black}}$$

with

- **â¢** *M*0: Modulation for 0 cy/mm
- **â¢** *Gwhite*: average grey level in the white patch
- **â¢** *Gblack*: average grey level in the black patch

Having determined *M*0 the value of the [CTF can be calculated from the modu](#page-163-3) lation of the Ronchi pattern: *CTF*(*R*) <sup>=</sup> *<sup>M</sup>*(*R*)) *M*<sup>0</sup>

with *M*(*R*) Modulation at spatial frequency *R*

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The values of the [CTF](#page-163-3) for each of the spatial frequencies specified in [Ta](#page-24-0) [ble 2.41](#page-24-0) (500 ppi scanners) or [Table 2.42](#page-25-0) (1000 ppi scanners) must be grea ter than the corresponding minimum [CTF](#page-163-3) and less than the corresponding maximum [CTF](#page-163-3) specified in the same table.
- **â¢** The resulting image SHALL be free from significant effects of aliasing.

### **Test Case ID: TC-AS-FI-ICS3-002**

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** Facial image acquisition by the [IUT](#page-163-1) is omitted.
- **â¢** The process terminates after the timer which starts at the point of leaving the capture area reaches the preset timeout.
- **â¢** No message containing the encoded facial image is returned via test in terface (bio:FaceAcquisition).

### **Test Case ID: TC-AS-FP-ROLL-001**

#### *Expected Result*

As a result per acquisition, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded fingerprint images is returned via the test interface (bio:Finger Acquisition and bio:Records)

For each captured fingerprint image of each test person, the following results are expected:

- **â¢** The resulting image shows the full width of the rolled fingerprint. Typically the image will roughly be of rectangular shape.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image does not depict visible distortion or inter ruptions. The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint from nail to nail.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image depicts a faithful reproduction of the fin gerprint, especially in the areas where the rolled fingerprint overlaps with the corresponding plain print.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image does not depict visible distortion or inter ruptions.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image does not depict puzzle effects such that parts of the fingerprint image are displaced from their actual position.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts friction ridges.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image does not depict blurring and smearing.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts ridge patterns.
- **â¢** If features exists for the given fingerprint:
	- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts features.
	- **â¢** If loop features exists for the given fingerprint:

The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts loop features (core and delta).

- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts existing features at the bor der zone of the image.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's upper part.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's core area with ridge lines.
- **â¢** If delta features exists for the given fingerprint:
	- The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprints delta features.
- **â¢** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's baseline (bottom area).
- **â¢** The vertical axis of the fingerprint depicted in captured image is par allel with the fingerprint image's vertical axis.
- **â¢** Note: In case of doubt whether one or several of the conditions above hold true for the given fingerprint, a dactyloscopy expert SHALL be consulted for clarification.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded facial image is returned via the test interface (bio:FaceAcquisition).
- **â¢** The colour depth is 24 bit and the colour space sRGB. Note, for scenarios where only a facial verification is performed a colour depth of 8 bit with grey scale is also possible.
- **â¢** The face is fully visible in foreground.
- **â¢** The minimum distance between both eyes is 120 pixels.
- **â¢** The processed image is cropped and de-rotated.
- **â¢** The size of the face within processed image meets geometric requi rements of [\[ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-164-1) , chapter 8.3, i.e.:
	- **â¢** The X coordinate of the centre of the face is between 45 % and 55 % of the image width.
	- **â¢** The Y coordinate of the centre of the face is between 30 % and 50 % (for children under the age of 11 between 30 % and 60 %) of the image height.
	- **â¢** The head width is between 50 % and 75 % of the image width.
	- **â¢** The head length is between 60 % and 90 % (for children under the age of 11 between 50 % and 90 %) of the vertical length of the image.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded facial image is returned via the test interface (bio:FaceAcquisitionand bio:Records)
- **â¢** The processed image has dimensions of exactly 1600\*1200 pixels (in regard to height and width), if it was larger before. Otherwise the dimensions of the image are unchanged
- **â¢** The height/width ratio of the processed image is 4:3
- **â¢** The minimum distance between both eyes is at least 120 pixels

### *Description:*

Check correct processing of facial images for [GSAT3](#page-163-6)

- **â¢** Initiate test case by loading the reference facial image using inter face
- **â¢** Examine the processed image

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The resulting image data is encoded and returned via the test interface in an appropriate XML format, i.e. as [GSAT3](#page-163-6) XML embedded within a TR-03121 XML (element bio:XMLRecord[@type="GSAT-xml"]), whereby only the contained facial image data (Element itl:FaceImage) is relevant for this test case
- **â¢** The processed image has dimensions of exactly 800\*600 pixels, if it was lar ger before. Otherwise the dimensions of the image are unchanged (height/ width ratio is 4:3)
- **â¢** The minimum distance between both eyes is at least 120 pixels

### *Description:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) is called via the conformance test interface and compliant facial images from the conformance test database are committed consecutive ly according to the respective table for quality threshold requirements of Function Module QA-FI-ARE.
- **â¢** The results returned by the [IUT are checked \(depending on the specific app](#page-163-1) lication profile at hand) if the expected quality values are available.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** For every facial image a "bio:FaceQuality" element is returned by the [IUT](#page-163-1) via the test interface.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) provides the quality values for all criteria marked with "M" in the respective table for quality threshold requirements of Function Module QA-FI-ARE.
- **â¢** If applicable, the quality values are correctly set:
	- **â¢** "id" (type string) identifier for the criteria
	- **â¢** "min" (type double) minimum value from the range of this criteria
	- **â¢** "max" (type double) maximum value from the range of this criteria
	- **â¢** "tmin" (type double) minimum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **â¢** "tmax" (type double) maximum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **â¢** "result" (type double) value of the quality evaluation result.
- **â¢** The acceptance conditions (i.e. defined tolerances, depending on the specific application at hand) are satisfied:
	- **â¢** tmin *Â¸* min, tmax *Â·* max
	- **â¢** min *Â·* result *Â·* max

### **Test Case ID: TC-QA-FP-APP-001**

### *Expected Result:*

For every input sequence an XML element is returned, containing the final selected sets of fingerprints (bio:Records) and the corresponding capture and quality information (bio:FingerAcquisiton).

### *Description:*

Examination of correct identification and comparison of the [IUTs](#page-163-1) selection of the best capture out of multiple captures with the Ground Truth database.

### *Expected Result:*

All expected finger codes and best sets of captures (as specified in the Ground Truth database) are identical with the actual received results of finger codes and returned fingerprint sequences and corresponding quality information.

### **Test Case ID: TC-PAD-FP-APP-002**

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** A compliant fingerprint image is acquired.
- **â¢** All acceptance conditions for the fingerprint image acquisition are satisfied and achieved.
- **â¢** No [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm is shown to the operator.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1)'s [PAD](#page-163-7) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack to the calling application. Also, an overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score (boolean) is returned.
- **â¢** The individual [PAD](#page-163-7) scores returned by the [IUT indicate a bona fide finger](#page-163-1) print presentation.
- **â¢** The overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score returned by the [IUT](#page-163-1) indicates no [PAD](#page-163-7) alarms.
- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded finger print image is returned via the test interface (bio:FingerAcquisition).

#### 2

- *Description:*
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) is called via the conformance test interface and a fingerprint pre sentation attack is performed, using the artefacts created from silicon. Each artefact SHALL be tested ten times.
- **â¢** To test whether the fingers for which there is a positive [PAD](#page-163-7) result are also assigned to the correct finger codes, proceed as follows:
	- **â¢** The artefact SHOULD be present for at least three different fingers of at least one hand.
	- **â¢** Exactly one finger of exactly hand SHOULD be equipped with the ar tefact per fingerprint acquisition.
	- **â¢** In order to ensure that not always the same finger is equipped with an artefact for each fingerprint acquisition, a rotation principle should be in place that specifies the equipment of a finger with an artefact chan ges or rolls in each pass.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** Fingerprint images are acquired.
- **â¢** A [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm is shown to the operator.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1)'s [PAD](#page-163-7) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack to the calling application. Also, an overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score (boolean) is returned.
- **â¢** The individual [PAD](#page-163-7) scores returned by the [IUT indicate a presentation at](#page-163-1) tack for fingers with artefacts and bona fide for fingers without artefacts.
- **â¢** The overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score returned by the [IUT](#page-163-1) indicates a [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm.
- **â¢** Every finger originating from an artefact is correctly assigned to its corre sponding finger code. (Abstract example: If there is a hand with four bona fide fingers and one finger originating from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-163-7) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the corresponding finger. Concrete example: If there is a hand with only the index finger coming from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-163-7) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the index finger.)
- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded finger print images is returned via the test interface (bio:FingerAcquisition).

### **Test Case ID: TC-PAD-FP-APP-002**

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** Fingerprint images are acquired.
- **â¢** A [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm is shown to the operator.

### *Description:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) is called via the conformance test interface and a fingerprint pre sentation attack is performed, using the artefacts created from wood glue. Each artefact SHALL be tested ten times.
- **â¢** To test whether the fingers for which there is a positive [PAD](#page-163-7) result are also assigned to the correct finger codes, proceed as follows:
	- **â¢** The artefact SHOULD be present for at least three different fingers of at least one hand.
	- **â¢** Exactly one finger of exactly hand SHOULD be equipped with the ar tefact per fingerprint acquisition.
	- **â¢** In order to ensure that not always the same finger is equipped with an artefact for each fingerprint acquisition, a rotation principle should be in place that specifies the equipment of a finger with an artefact chan ges or rolls in each pass.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** Fingerprint images are acquired.
- **â¢** A [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm is shown to the operator.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1)'s [PAD](#page-163-7) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack to the calling application. Also, an overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score (boolean) is returned.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** Fingerprint images are acquired.
- **â¢** A [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm is shown to the operator.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1)'s [PAD](#page-163-7) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack to the calling application. Also, an overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score (boolean) is returned.
- **â¢** The individual [PAD](#page-163-7) scores returned by the [IUT indicate a presentation at](#page-163-1) tack for fingers with artefacts and bona fide for fingers without artefacts.
- **â¢** The overall [PAD](#page-163-7) score returned by the [IUT](#page-163-1) indicates a [PAD](#page-163-7) alarm.
- **â¢** Every finger originating from an artefact is correctly assigned to its corre sponding finger code. (Abstract example: If there is a hand with four bona fide fingers and one finger originating from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-163-7) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the corresponding finger. Concrete example: If there is a hand with only the index finger coming from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-163-7) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the index finger.)
- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded finger print images is returned via the test interface (bio:FingerAcquisition).

### *Description:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) is called via the conformance test interface and a fingerprint pre sentation attack is performed, using the artefacts created from latex with window painting. Each artefact SHALL be tested ten times.
- **â¢** To test whether the fingers for which there is a positive [PAD](#page-163-7) result are also assigned to the correct finger codes, proceed as follows:
	- **â¢** The artefact SHOULD be present for at least three different fingers of at least one hand.
	- **â¢** Exactly one finger of exactly hand SHOULD be equipped with the ar tefact per fingerprint acquisition.
	- **â¢** In order to ensure that not always the same finger is equipped with an artefact for each fingerprint acquisition, a rotation principle should be in place that specifies the equipment of a finger with an artefact chan ges or rolls in each pass.

### *Description:*

Examination of the documentation provided by vendor identificati on algorithm.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The documentation gives evidence that the comparison algorithms achieve one of the following operating points:
	- **â¢** A maximum [false-positive-identification-rate \(FPIR\)](#page-163-13) of 1 % and a [fal](#page-163-14) [se-negative-identification-rate \(FNIR\)](#page-163-14) below 2,5 %

or

**â¢** a maximum [FPIR](#page-163-13) of 0.1 % and a [FNIR](#page-163-14) below 5 %.

or

- **â¢** a maximum [FPIR](#page-163-13) of 0.01 % and a [FNIR](#page-163-14) below 10 %.
- **â¢** The claims stated above are supported by test results for a series of tests per formed on a database which is of similar size and characteristics as the one been used in the current application scenario.
- **â¢** Information about the data used for calibration of algorithm is pro vided, especially
	- **â¢** the size and image characteristics of the database which was used for training the algorithm is stated.
	- **â¢** the conversion routine between raw scores and threshold defined by Fal se Positive Identification Rate is stated.
- **â¢** The documentation states that the system also provides a list of potential matches for which their respective score exceeds the thresholds configured for the system. The documentation gives proof that the maximum size of this list can be configured.
- **â¢** The documentation gives evidence that the comparison algorithm can be calibrated for different use cases, especially higher [FPIR](#page-163-13) values in case of watchlist comparison scenarios.

- **â¢** no provision of pre-defined input data; Test case initiation via test interface (TR-03122-1, Chap ter 4, "Conformance Test Interfaces")
- **â¢** HTTP method: GET
- **â¢** test case variants:

/TR03122/TC-CMP-FP-CC-002/1

*Description*

**Table 2.154** TC-CMP-FP-CC-002 Test Case Variants **Step Description / Expected Result**

*Description:*

Check [IUT](#page-163-1) correct behaviour of a mated crossmatching

- **â¢** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-163-1) via the test interface
- **â¢** Capture 10 fingerprints, each fingerprint plain and rolled (in identical, ma ted order)
- **â¢** Resulting in a total of 10 captured fingerprint pairs (plain, rolled) of identical fingerprints

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition, including information on the capture and crossmatching results)
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) returns a comparison score per pair of prints and each finger and a result of each verification (element bio:ControlVerification)
- **â¢** Each single comparison score is above the threshold and each verification result is positive

#### *Description:*

Check [IUT](#page-163-1) correct behaviour of a non-mated crossmatching

- **â¢** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-163-1) via the test interface
- **â¢** Capture 10 fingerprints, each fingerprint rolled and plain (non-mated, e.g. by applying fingerprints of a second person or permuting fingers)
- **â¢** Resulting in a total of 10 captured pairs (rolled, plain) of distinct fingerprints

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition, including information on the capture and crossmatching results)
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) returns a comparison score per pair of prints and each finger and a result of each verification (element bio:ControlVerification)
- **â¢** Non-mated crossmatchings (distinct fingers) yield a comparison score be low the threshold and a negative verification result

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The XML-element FaceAcquisition and/or FaceAcquisition MAY exist multiple times (including their Records/BinaryRecord children).
- **â¢**
- **â¢** The XML-element FaceAcquisition/Records/BinaryRecord/@type and/or FaceDelivery/Records/BinaryRecord/@type is jpeg when com ing from a face acquisition or delivery process.
- **â¢** The XML-element FaceAcquisition/Records/BinaryRecord/Bina ryData/Value or FaceDelivery/Records/BinaryRecord/BinaryDa ta/Valueoccurs exactly once before being sent to document production af ter the selection procedure. The output image fulfills the requirements to be sent to the document production (e.g. FaceAcquisition/Records/Bi naryRecord/@type or FaceDelivery/Records/BinaryRecord/@type is jpeg2000). All other binary data values of face deliveries or acquisitions have been deleted. However, multiple appearances of these elements are permit ted before being fed to the selection procedure (e.g. from any acquisition or delivery application).
- **â¢** Neither the XML-element FaceAcquisition/Records/XMLRecord nor the XML-element FaceDelivery/Records/XMLRecord is used.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** All acceptance conditions (no multiple faces and optimal distance) are met according to FM AS-FI-ICS3.
- **â¢** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded facial image is returned (bio:FaceAcquisition).

### *Description:*

The biometric subject performs an non-conformant face presentation, e.g. the biometric subject does not look in the camera or disappears from the system.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) captures a face image.
- **â¢** Depending on the [PAD](#page-163-7) configuration, the [IUT](#page-163-1) performs a [PAD](#page-163-7).
- **â¢** In case the [IUT](#page-163-1) performs a [PAD, all acceptance conditions are met accord](#page-163-7) ing to PAD-FI-APP.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) assesses the quality of the captured face image.
- **â¢** The acceptance conditions are met according to QA-FI-GENERIC.

### *Description:*

The biometric subject repeats Step 3 for the duration of configured time out.

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) repeats the automated face image acquisition process until the timeout exceeds.
- **â¢** After the timeout is exceeded the [IUT aborts the face image acquisition pro](#page-163-1) cess.
- **â¢** After the timeout is exceeded a message conforming to TR-03121 XML con taining the encoded facial image exhibiting the best quality of all captured images may be returned (bio:FaceAcquisition).

### *Description:*

Check the automatic capturing of an insufficient facial image.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Place the biometric test subject inproperly in front of the digital camera. The quality assessment of the captured images has to be negative for every capture. At least two images SHALL be captured.
- **â¢** Wait for the timeout.
- **â¢** Accept the displayed image.

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) captured a facial images automatically.
- **â¢** A quality assessment of the captured images was negative.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) chose the best captured image and displayes it.
- **â¢** The image can be cropped and rotated manually.
- **â¢** The image is released to the requesting application after beeing accepted.
- **â¢** As a result, an image is returned via the test interface in XML-Log confor ming to TR-03121 XML.

### *Description:*

Check the behaviour of captured images.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Start the acquisition process and switch to the single finger acquisition.
- **â¢** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-163-1) for the single finger placement on the scanner for the biometric test subject, but place fingers in such a man ner (with bad quality) that the pre-qualification is insufficient.
- **â¢** The operator forces the capture manually.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** [PAD](#page-163-7) has been performed and no warning or error is shown.
- **â¢** Uniqueness check has been performed and no warning or error for duplica ted fingerprints is shown. Further, the overall result of the uniqueness check is logged properly.
- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the fingerprint and its QA value is returned via the test interface.

### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, but with hardware reported issues

- **â¢** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-163-1) via the test interface
- **â¢** Perform the control slap acquisition regularly, e.g. without inducing errors
- **â¢** Enforce a hardware reported issue during the rolled capture process for at least one finger. Consult the documentation of the hardware in regards of supported issues (e.g. "finger shifted")
- **â¢** Repeat the capture without enforcing any further errors and finalize ac quisition process

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) detects the hardware issue and restarts acquisition of cur rent finger.
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) finishes without any error message.
- **â¢** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw finger print data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or descen dant of the sibling element bio:Records. The rejectionReason element matches the reason chosen by the operator.

#### 2

### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints in sufficient quality and with hardware reported issues

- **â¢** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-163-1) via the test interface
- **â¢** Perform the control slap acquisition regularly, e.g. without inducing errors
- **â¢** Enforce a hardware reported issue during the rolled capture process for at least one finger. Consult the documentation of the hardware in regards of supported issues (e.g. shift)
- **â¢** Two times: Enforce insufficient quality of the same fingerprint during the capture
- **â¢** For the remaining fingers: perform the acquisition process as usual

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) detects the hardware issue and restarts the rolled acquisition of the current finger
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) detects the insufficient quality and restarts the rolled acquisition of the current finger
- **â¢** The acquisition was repeated twice in total (one time due to the rolling is sue, one time due to the quality)
- **â¢** The [IUT](#page-163-1) finishes without any error message
- **â¢** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records. The repetition with the best [QA](#page-163-12) score is marked as "selected" and the rejectionReason for the first attempts matches the reason chosen by the operator.

### *Description:*

Check the quality assessment, [PAD](#page-163-7), uniqueness check result and time required for the fingerprint image acquisition.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Present single fingers subsequently.
- **â¢** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-163-1) for the placement of one finger on the scanner for the biometric test subject.

### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** [PAD](#page-163-7) has been performed for the fingerprint image and no warning or error (such as uniqueness check error) is shown.
- **â¢** The quality assessment is performed for the fingerprint image.
- **â¢** The overall fingerprint capture process was performed in under ten se conds.
- **â¢** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded images with the QA value, PAD result, uniqueness check result and potenti ally captured surveillance images is returned via the test interface.

### *Description:*

Check the timeout of the capturing process.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Increase the minimum required quality thresholds for the fingerprint to 100.
- **â¢** Consecutively present single fingerprints.
- **â¢** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-163-1) for the placement of the single finger on the scanner for the biometric test subject.

#### *Expected Result:*

- **â¢** [PAD](#page-163-7) has been performed for the fingerprint image and no warning or error (such as uniqueness check error) is shown.
- **â¢** The quality assessment is performed for the fingerprint image and over all quality assessment is negative.
- **â¢** The capturing process is restarted until the timeout of ten seconds is reached.
- **â¢** After the timeout is reached the captured fingerprint with best quality is identified and a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the en coded images with the QA value, PAD result, uniqueness check re sult and potentially captured surveillance images is returned via the test in terface.

#### 3

### *Description:*

Check the Process with missing fingers.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Present no finger.

*Expected Result:*

The process ended without capturing the fingerprint.

4

### *Description:*

Check sequence error function.

- **â¢** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **â¢** Present a single finger.
- **â¢** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-163-1) for the placement of the single finger on the scanner for the biometric test subject.
- **â¢** Present the same single finger a second time, following the instructions of the [IUT for the placement of single finger on scanner bio](#page-163-1) metric test subject.
- **â¢** Present the same single finger a third time, following the instructions of the [IUT](#page-163-1) for the placement of the single finger on the scanner for the biometric test subject.

*Expected Result:*

- **â¢** After the second presentation of the same finger, a warning message about the detected sequence error (i.e. "This finger has already been captured.") is shown to the biometric subject.
- **â¢** After the third presentation of the same finger, the process ends without capturing a fingerprint.
