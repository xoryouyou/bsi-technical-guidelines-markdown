A flexible target has to be pres<br>sed against the scanner platen to make sure the target is in contact with the<br>platen over the entire pattern area. To discern properties of the scanner and<br>the target the procedure may be repeated with the target being rotated by 180<br>degrees. If accuracy failures in the images remain at the same location they are<br>most probably due to the scanner. |  |  |  |

#### *Description:*

The target is placed on the scanner platen and images are taken with the lines of the Ronchi pattern parallel to pixel columns (vertical bars) and rows (ho rizontal bars) of the image sensor, respectively. A flexible target has to be pres sed against the scanner platen to make sure the target is in contact with the platen over the entire pattern area. If the target pattern covers less than 25% of the scanners capture area, the procedure is applied to the right and the left half of the capture area, respectively. The bars Ronchi patterns have to be ali gned with the pixel rows and columns to an angle less than 0.5°. If the images from the scanner are inverted they have to be back show dark pat terns on a bright background.

#### *Expected Result:*

Set of images with the bars Ronchi pattern in vertical and horizontal di rection, showing dark patterns on a bright background.

*Description:*

The resulting images files are converted to TIFF format and are processed with the tool WinMTF. This program determines the modulation in each of the Ronchi test patterns. These modulation values are absolute with respect to the dynamic range of the image and do not represent the [contrast transfer func](#page-168-3) [tion \(CTF\)](#page-168-3).

#### *Expected Result:*

Absolute modulation values for each of the Ronchi patterns on the test chart.

*Description:*

The absolute modulation values have to be normalized by the modulation of the large black and white patches on test chart, representing a spatial fre quency of approximately zero cycles per millimetre. The average grey level in the black and white patches is calculated and the modulation is calculated as

$$\text{followes: } M\_0 = \frac{G\_{white} - G\_{black}}{G\_{white} + G\_{black}}$$

with

- **•** *M*0: Modulation for 0 cy/mm
- **•** *Gwhite*: average grey level in the white patch
- **•** *Gblack*: average grey level in the black patch

Having determined *M*0 the value of the [CTF can be calculated from the modu](#page-168-3) lation of the Ronchi pattern: *CTF*(*R*) <sup>=</sup> *<sup>M</sup>*(*R*)) *M*<sup>0</sup>

with *M*(*R*) Modulation at spatial frequency *R*

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The values of the [CTF](#page-168-3) for each of the spatial frequencies specified in [Ta](#page-25-0) [ble 2.39](#page-25-0) (500 ppi scanners) or [Table 2.40](#page-25-1) (1000 ppi scanners) must be grea ter than the corresponding minimum [CTF](#page-168-3) and less than the corresponding maximum [CTF](#page-168-3) specified in the same table.
- **•** The resulting image SHALL be free from significant effects of aliasing.

#### **Test Case ID: TC-AH-FP-OPT-004**

*Expected Result:*

**•** Signal to noise ratio: Signal is defined as the difference between the average grey levels of corresponding blocks in the white and black image. Noi se is defined as the standard deviation of the grey levels in each block of the white and black image, respectively. The signal-noise ratio is calculated as

$$\text{with } SNR\_{black} = \frac{\overline{G\_{white}} - \overline{G\_{black}}}{\sigma\_{black}}, SNR\_{white} = \frac{\overline{G\_{white}} - \overline{G\_{black}}}{\sigma\_{white}}$$

*Gwhite; Gblack*: average grey level in a block of the black and white image, re spectively

*¾white; ¾black*: standard deviation of the grey levels in a block of the black and white image, respectively

The signal to noise ratio SHALL exceed 125 for at least 97% of the tested blocks in both the black and the white image.

- **•** Grey level uniformity requirement #1 (adjacent row, column uniformi ty): At least 99% of the average grey levels between every two adjacent 6.35 mm long rows and 99% between every two adjacent 6.35 mm long columns, SHALL not differ by more than 1.0 grey levels in the black and SHALL not differ by more than 2.0 grey levels in the white image.
- **•** Grey level uniformity requirement #2 (pixel to pixel uniformity): For at least 99.9% of all pixels within every independent 6.35 mm x 6.35 mm block no individual pixel's grey level SHALL vary from the average by more than 8.0 grey levels in the black image, and SHALL not vary from average by mo re than 22.0 grey levels in the white image.
- **•** Grey level uniformity requirement #3 (small area uniformity): For every two independent 6.35 mm x 6.35 mm blocks the average grey levels of the two blocks SHALL not differ by more than 3.0 grey levels in the black image, and SHALL not differ by more than 12.0 grey levels in the white image.

#### **Test Case ID: TC-AS-FP-ROLL-001**

#### *Expected Result*

As a result per acquisition, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded fingerprint images is returned via the test interface (bio:Finger Acquisition and bio:Records)

For each captured fingerprint image of each test person, the following results are expected:

- **•** The resulting image shows the full width of the rolled fingerprint. Typically the image will roughly be of rectangular shape.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image does not depict visible distortion or inter ruptions. The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint from nail to nail.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image depicts a faithful reproduction of the fin gerprint, especially in the areas where the rolled fingerprint overlaps with the corresponding plain print.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image does not depict visible distortion or inter ruptions.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image does not depict puzzle effects such that parts of the fingerprint image are displaced from their actual position.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts friction ridges.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image does not depict blurring and smearing.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts ridge patterns.
- **•** If features exists for the given fingerprint:
	- **•** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts features.
	- **•** If loop features exists for the given fingerprint:
	- The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts loop features (core and delta).
- **•** The captured fingerprint image clearly depicts existing features at the bor der zone of the image.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's upper part.
- **•** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's core area with ridge lines.
- **•** If delta features exists for the given fingerprint:

The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprints delta features.

- **•** The captured fingerprint image depicts the fingerprint's baseline (bottom area).
- **•** The vertical axis of the fingerprint depicted in captured image is par allel with the fingerprint image's vertical axis.
- **•** Note: In case of doubt whether one or several of the conditions above hold true for the given fingerprint, a dactyloscopy expert SHALL be consulted for clarification.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing two encoded fingerprint images is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition and bio:Records).
- **•** Two independent images are returned within the data.
- **•** A correct segmentation has been performed. In case of uncertainty, the test SHALL be repeated.
- **•** No upscaling has been applied to the fingerprint images. The fingerprint images may have been evenly surrounded with white pixels to reach the de sired size if the targeted system or database requires fingerprint images of higher size than captured the fingerprint images.

#### *Description:*

- **•** Start of the acquisition of one fingerprint by correct placement of one finger on the sensor and extraction of fingerprint image from resulting da ta.
- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing one encoded fingerprint image is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition and bio:Records).
- **•** A correct segmentation has been performed. In case of uncertainty, the test SHALL be repeated.
- **•** No upscaling has been applied to the fingerprint image. The fingerprint image may have been evenly surrounded with white pixels to reach the de sired size if the targeted system or database requires fingerprint images of higher size than captured the fingerprint image.

#### *Description:*

- **•** Start of the acquisition of two fingerprints by positioning the fingers rotated up to 45 degrees on the sensor (both fingers in same direction) and ex traction of the fingerprint images from the resulting data.
- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface.
- **•** Note: In case the [IUT rejects strongly rotated fingerprints such that the cap](#page-168-2) ture process does not yield a biometric sample, the capture process can be initiated manually.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing two encoded fingerprint images is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition and bio:Records).
- **•** Two independent images are returned within the data.
- **•** The fingerprints are corrected to be vertical in the image which is manually verified by the examiner.
- **•** A correct segmentation has been performed. In case of uncertainty, the test SHALL be repeated.
- **•** No upscaling has been applied to the fingerprint images. The fingerprint images may have been evenly surrounded with white pixels to reach the de sired size if the targeted system or database requires fingerprint images of higher size than captured the fingerprint images.

### **Test Case ID: TC-BIP-FP-APP-002** *Expected Results:* **•** As a result, a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing one encoded fingerprint image is returned via the test interface (element bio:FingerAcquisition and bio:Records). **•** Image contains only the first part of the finger. **•** A correct segmentation has been performed. In case of uncertainty, the test

SHALL be repeated.

**•** No upscaling has been applied to the fingerprint image. The fingerprint image may have been evenly surrounded with white pixels to reach the de sired size if the targeted system or database requires fingerprint images of higher size than captured the fingerprint image.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** For every facial image a "bio:FaceQuality" element is returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface.
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) provides the quality values for all criteria marked with "M" in the respective table for quality threshold requirements of Function Module QA-FI-ARE.
- **•** If applicable, the quality values are correctly set:
	- **•** "id" (type string) identifier for the criteria
	- **•** "min" (type double) minimum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "max" (type double) maximum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmin" (type double) minimum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmax" (type double) maximum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "result" (type double) value of the quality evaluation result.
- **•** The acceptance conditions (i.e. defined tolerances, depending on the specific application at hand) are satisfied:
	- **•** tmin *¸* min, tmax *·* max
	- **•** min *·* result *·* max

#### **Test Case ID: TC-QA-FI-ARE-001**

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** For every facial image a "bio:FaceQuality" element is returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface.
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) may provide quality values for criteria marked with "O" in the re spective table for quality threshold requirements of Function Module QA-FI-ARE.
- **•** If applicable, the quality values are correctly set:
	- **•** "id" (type string) identifier for the criteria
	- **•** "min" (type double) minimum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "max" (type double) maximum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmin" (type double) minimum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmax" (type double) maximum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "result" (type double) value of the quality evaluation result

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is called via the conformance test interface and compliant facial images from the conformance test database are committed consecutively according to QA-FI-GENERIC criteria.
- **•** The results returned by the [IUT are checked \(depending on the specific app](#page-168-2) lication profile at hand) if the expected quality values are available.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** For every facial image a "bio:FaceQuality" element is returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface.
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) provides the quality values for all criteria marked with "M" in the respective Function Module.
- **•** If applicable, the quality values are correctly set:
	- **•** "id" (type string) identifier for the criteria
	- **•** "min" (type double) minimum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "max" (type double) maximum value from the range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmin" (type double) minimum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "tmax" (type double) maximum value of the allowed tolerance range of this criteria
	- **•** "result" (type double) value of the quality evaluation result.
- **•** The acceptance conditions (i.e. defined tolerances, depending on the specific application at hand) are satisfied:
	- **•** tmin *¸* min, tmax *·* max
	- **•** min *·* result *·* max

### **Test Case ID: TC-PAD-FI-APP-002** *Scope* Examination of availability and correctness of [PAD](#page-168-10) functionality in the context of the acquisition of facial images with and without [Presentation Attack Instrument \(PAI\)](#page-168-12) in use. *Preconditions* **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is in operation, required modules are loaded. **•** The camera system used in the specific application scenario is connected. **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) implements an interface for conformance testing where a single image can be captured. **•** The [PAD](#page-168-10) functionality of the [IUT](#page-168-2) is activated for performing the test case. **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is able to return the results for every captured image via the test interface. **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is able to return the results for the conducted [PAD](#page-168-10). **•** Four different artefacts of each of the eight artefact classes SHALL be created, so that a total of 32 artefacts are obtained. The following artefacts (partial and full) can be used during test cases: 1. Masks created from casted silicon, big (size of a face) and small (smaller than a normal face), in different thicknesses 2. Masks created from latex in different thicknesses and styles 3. Masks printed on paper in different thicknesses and styles 4. Masks printed with 3D-printer in different thicknesses and styles 5. Photographs displayed on electronic devices, e.g. phones, tablets, laptops, etc. 6. Videos displayed on electronic devices, e.g. phones, tablets, laptops, etc. 7. Faces printed on paper with different thicknesses and structures of paper and different structures of printing (colouring, etc.) 8. Faces printed on fabrics with different thicknesses and structures of the fabrics and different methods of printing (flock print, silk screening, etc.)

**•** At least two different biometric subjects SHALL present bona fide faces during the test case.

**Test Case ID: TC-PAD-FI-APP-002** *CTS Mode* **•** interactive **•** no provision of pre-defined input data **•** HTTP method: GET **•** test case variants: /TR03122/TC-PAD-FI-APP-001/1/ **Table 2.139** TC-PAD-FI-APP-002 Test Case Variants **Step Descriptions/ Expected Results** *Description:* **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is called via the conformance test interface and a compliant face presentation is performed. **•** At least two biometric subjects perform a compliant face presentation (bona fide) in the [IUT](#page-168-2)'s capture area. The bona fide face of each biometric subject SHALL be tested ten times. 1 *Expected Results:* **•** A compliant facial image is acquired. **•** All acceptance conditions for the facial image acquisition are satisfied and achieved. **•** No [PAD](#page-168-10) alarm is shown to the operator. **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2)'s [PAD](#page-168-10) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 1 indicates bona fide and 0 presentation attack to the calling application. **•** The [PAD](#page-168-10) score returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) indicates a bona fide face presentation. **•** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded facial image is returned via the test interface (bio:FaceAcquisition). *Description:* **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is called via the conformance test interface and a face presentation is performed. **•** At least two biometric subjects present each mask made from different ma terials including paper, silicon, printed 3D and latex, either by wearing the mask or by using a special construction in the [IUT](#page-168-2)'s capture area. Each arte fact SHALL be tested ten times. *Description* 2 *Expected Results:* **•** A facial image is acquired. **•** A [PAD](#page-168-10) alarm is shown to the operator. **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2)'s [PAD](#page-168-10) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 1 indicates bona fide and 0 presentation attack to the calling application. **•** The [PAD](#page-168-10) score returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) indicates a presentation attack. **•** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded facial image is returned via the test interface (bio:FaceAcquisition).

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** Fingerprint images are acquired.
- **•** A [PAD](#page-168-10) alarm is shown to the operator.
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2)'s [PAD](#page-168-10) returns its detection results in the form of a normalized PAD score in the range [0,1] where 1 indicates bona fide and 0 presentation attack to the calling application. Also, an overall [PAD](#page-168-10) score (boolean) is returned.
- **•** The individual [PAD](#page-168-10) scores returned by the [IUT indicate a presentation at](#page-168-2) tack for fingers with artefacts and bona fide for fingers without artefacts.
- **•** The overall [PAD](#page-168-10) score returned by the [IUT](#page-168-2) indicates a [PAD](#page-168-10) alarm.
- **•** Every finger originating from an artefact is correctly assigned to its corre sponding finger code. (Abstract example: If there is a hand with four bona fide fingers and one finger originating from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-168-10) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the corresponding finger. Concrete example: If there is a hand with only the index finger coming from an artefact, then the [PAD](#page-168-10) score stating it is a presentation attack is assigned to the index finger.)
- **•** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded finger print images is returned via the test interface (bio:FingerAcquisition).

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) is called via the conformance test interface and a fingerprint pre sentation attack is performed, using the artefacts created from latex. Each artefact SHALL be tested ten times.
- **•** To test whether the fingers for which there is a positive [PAD](#page-168-10) result are also assigned to the correct finger codes, proceed as follows:
	- **•** The artefact SHOULD be present for at least three different fingers of at least one hand.
	- **•** Exactly one finger of exactly hand SHOULD be equipped with the ar tefact per fingerprint acquisition.
	- **•** In order to ensure that not always the same finger is equipped with an artefact for each fingerprint acquisition, a rotation principle should be in place that specifies the equipment of a finger with an artefact chan ges or rolls in each pass.

	- **•** A maximum [false-positive-identification-rate \(FPIR\)](#page-168-13) of 1 % and a [fal](#page-168-14) [se-negative-identification-rate \(FNIR\)](#page-168-14) below 2,5 %

or

**•** a maximum [FPIR](#page-168-13) of 0.1 % and a [FNIR](#page-168-14) below 5 %.

or

- **•** a maximum [FPIR](#page-168-13) of 0.01 % and a [FNIR](#page-168-14) below 10 %.
- **•** The claims stated above are supported by test results for a series of tests per formed on a database which is of similar size and characteristics as the one been used in the current application scenario.
- **•** Information about the data used for calibration of algorithm is pro vided, especially
	- **•** the size and image characteristics of the database which was used for training the algorithm is stated.
	- **•** the conversion routine between raw scores and threshold defined by Fal se Positive Identification Rate is stated.
- **•** The documentation states that the system also provides a list of potential matches for which their respective score exceeds the thresholds configured for the system. The documentation gives proof that the maximum size of this list can be configured.
- **•** The documentation gives evidence that the comparison algorithm can be calibrated for different use cases, especially higher [FPIR](#page-168-13) values in case of watchlist comparison scenarios.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** The documentation gives information (typically a [DET](#page-168-15) curve) of the perfor mance of the algorithm based on a data.
- **•** The documentation gives evidence that the comparison algorithm ensures a working point of a maximum [FMR](#page-168-16) of 0.1 % and a [FNMR below 2 %. Stron](#page-168-17) ger settings are allowed (lower [FMR](#page-168-16) and/or [FNMR\)](#page-168-17).
- **•** The documentation gives evidence that the comparison algorithm can be calibrated for the security level set within this specific scenario of verificati on.

#### **Test Case ID: TC-PAP-ACQ-FPS-SV-1\_004**

*Expected Results:*

- **•** The instructions were displayed and correct for the captured fingers.
- **•** The process ended without capturing the second slap.
- **•** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the images for cap tured fingers is returned via the test interface.
- **•** In case the quality of captured slap was too bad and therefore a segmen tation was not possible, an error message is shown. In this case a TR-03121 XML is not required.

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Perform the acquisition process of the two fingerprints

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware in the two finger mode (right index and left index)
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, two encoded fingerprints (left and right index fingers) are retur ned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to performed ac quisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-ele ments). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records

#### *Description:*

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Mark index finger of the right hand as handicapped
- **•** Perform the acquisition process

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) allows marking handicapped fingers before acquisition
- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware
- **•** The marked finger is excluded from the acquisition process
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) changes to single finger mode
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, two encoded fingerprints (right thumb, left index finger) are re turned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML.

*Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Perform the acquisition process of the two fingerprints

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware in the two finger mode (right index and left index)
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, two encoded fingerprints (both index fingers) are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this ele ment or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records

#### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, with a handicap on the right slap

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Mark index finger of the right slap as handicapped
- **•** Perform the acquisition process

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) allows marking handicapped fingers before acquisition
- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware
- **•** The marked finger is excluded from the acquisition process
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) changes to single finger mode
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, two encoded fingerprints (right thumb, left index finger) are re turned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to performed ac quisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-ele ments).

#### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, with a missing hand.

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Mark a whole hand (right or left) as not available/handicapped
- **•** Perform the acquisition process

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) allows marking a hand (or all fingers of one hand individually) as not available before acquisition
- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware
- **•** The marked hand is excluded from the acquisition process
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) captures two fingerprints from the existing hand
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message

#### **Test Case ID: TC-PAP-ACQ-FP2P-SV-2\_002**

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The acquisition is triggered by placing the finger(s) on hard ware in the two finger mode (right index and left index)
- **•** The acquisition is triggered not until the operator forced capture manu ally.
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, two encoded fingerprints (both index fingers) are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this ele ment or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records

#### **Test Case ID: TC-PAP-ACQ-FP10R-SV-1\_001**

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The acquisition of the reference slaps is performed by the [IUT](#page-168-2)
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) successively performs the acquisition of the rolled fingerprints
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records
- 2

#### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, with a handicapped finger

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Mark one finger as handicapped in the [IUT](#page-168-2)
- **•** Perform the acquisition process for the control slaps
- **•** Perform the acquisition process for the rolled prints

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) allows marking handicapped fingers before acquisition
- **•** The marked finger is excluded from both acquisition processes
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, nine encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records

#### 3

*Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, with multiple handicapped fingers

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Mark multiple fingers as handicapped in the [IUT](#page-168-2)
- **•** Perform the acquisition process for the control slaps
- **•** Perform the acquisition process for the rolled prints

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) allows marking multiple handicapped fingers before acquisition
- **•** The marked fingers are excluded from both acquisition processes
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, encoded fingerprints (depending on missing ones) are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to performed acqui sition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-ele ments). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records

#### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints suf ficient quality, but with hardware reported issues

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Perform the control slap acquisition regularly, e.g. without inducing errors
- **•** Enforce a hardware reported issue during the rolled capture process for at least one finger. Consult the documentation of the hardware in regards of supported issues (e.g. "finger shifted")
- **•** Repeat the capture without enforcing any further errors and finalize ac quisition process

#### *Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) detects the hardware issue and restarts acquisition of cur rent finger
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw finger print data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or descen dant of the sibling element bio:Records. The rejectionReason element matches the reason chosen by the operator.

#### *Description:*

Check the correct execution of acquisition process with fingerprints in sufficient quality and with hardware reported issues

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Perform the control slap acquisition regularly, e.g. without inducing errors
- **•** Enforce a hardware reported issue during the rolled capture process for at least one finger. Consult the documentation of the hardware in regards of supported issues (e.g. shift)
- **•** Two times: Enforce insufficient quality of the same fingerprint during the capture
- **•** For the remaining fingers: perform the acquisition process as usual

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) detects the hardware issue and restarts the rolled acquisition of the current finger
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) detects the insufficient quality and restarts the rolled acquisition of the current finger
- **•** The acquisition was repeated twice in total (one time due to the rolling is sue, one time due to the quality)
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) finishes without any error message
- **•** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records. The repetition with the best [QA](#page-168-11) score is marked as "selected" and the rejectionReason for the first attempts matches the reason chosen by the operator.

#### *Description:*

Check the ability of operators to accept negative capture results in case both fingerprints of insufficient quality and hardware reported issues are encounte red

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-168-2) via the test interface
- **•** Perform the control slap acquisition regularly, e.g. without inducing errors
- **•** Enforce a hardware reported issue during the rolled capture process for at least one finger. Consult the documentation of the hardware in regards of supported issues (e.g. shift)
- **•** Enforce insufficient quality of the same fingerprint during capture
- **•** Enforce another hardware reported issue during the final capture attempt for the finger. Afterwards select the option to keep the current results
- **•** For the remaining fingers: perform the acquisition process as usual

*Expected Result:*

- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) detects the hardware issue and restarts acquisition of cur rent finger
- **•** The [IUT](#page-168-2) detects the insufficient quality and restarts the acquisition of the current finger
- **•** The detects the hardware issue and offers to either restart the capture or to continue with the current result
- **•** As a result, ten encoded fingerprints are returned via the test interface in a message conforming to TR-03121 XML. The XML must also include the information corresponding to the performed acquisition process (element bio:FingerAcquisition and relevant sub-elements). The raw fingerprint data may be stored either as sub-element of this element or as descendant of the sibling element bio:Records. The first repetition with insufficient [QA](#page-168-11) score is marked as "selected" and the rejectionReason for the first and last attempts matches the reason chosen by the operator.

#### **Test Case ID: TC-PAP-ACQ-FP2P-USV-1\_001**

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** The captured slap image are segmented into two single fingerprint images.
- **•** [PAD](#page-168-10) has been performed for each single fingerprint image and no warning or error (such as uniqueness check error) is shown.
- **•** The quality assessment is performed for each single fingerprint image indi vidually.
- **•** The slap classification is performed.
- **•** The overall finger slap capture process was performed in under ten seconds.
- **•** A message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded images with the QA value, PAD result, result of slap classifier, uni queness check result and potentially captured surveillance images is retur ned via the test interface.

#### *Description:*

Check the timeout of the capturing process.

- **•** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **•** Increase the minimum required quality thresholds for each fingerprint to 100.
- **•** Consecutively present slap with two fingers.
- **•** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-168-2) for the slap placement on the scanner for the biometric test subject.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** The captured slap image are segmented into two single fingerprint images.
- **•** [PAD](#page-168-10) has been performed for each single fingerprint image and no warning or error (such as uniqueness check error) is shown.
- **•** The quality assessment is performed for each single fingerprint image indi vidually and the overall quality assessment is negative.
- **•** The slap classification is performed.
- **•** The capturing process is restarted until the timeout of 10 seconds is reached.
- **•** After the timeout is reached captured slap with best quality identi fied and a message conforming to TR-03121 XML containing the encoded images with the QA value, the PAD result, the result of the slap classifier, the uniqueness check result and potentially captured surveillance images is re turned via the test interface.

#### *Description:*

Check the Process with missing fingers.

- **•** Initiate test case using the test interface.
- **•** Present slap with at least one finger missing.
- **•** Follow the instructions of the [IUT](#page-168-2) for the slap placement on the scanner for the biometric test subject.

#### *Expected Results:*

- **•** The captured fingers are discarded.
- **•** The process ended without capturing the slap.
