# <span id="page-12-0"></span>**1 Description of the application area for "NFC based eTicketing in public transport"**

In order to use public transport a passenger requires an entitlement, otherwise known as a ticket. This entitlement is traditionally in the form of a paper ticket, to which the passenger gives validity (stamps, validates) when issued or when the journey begins, and which may be checked by an inspector in the vehicle or on the platform.

In the descriptions of the application scenarios for "eTicketing for events" and "eTicketing in public transport", NFC carrier media in "Smart Object Mode" are used â which means media such as Smart Cards and Smart Tickets. In these cases, the NFC carrier medium plays a passive role when communicating with an ISO14443 reader.

However, NFC technology also offers the possibility of the customer medium playing an active role. In such cases, the NFC device functions as an active reader which controls communication with another NFC device or an ISO14443 transponder. Both roles, and the applications they involve, can be implemented together in a single NFC carrier medium.

This active capability of NFC carrier media can be used for certain application scenarios in order to use permanently installed transponders to replace the local recording infrastructure required for chip cards. This in turn makes it possible to establish a complementary, technically interoperable system infrastructure for chip cards and NFC devices.

This is especially attractive in the field of public transport, because the cost of the infrastructure that has to be installed in vehicles and at stations or bus stops is high. Highly frequented areas can continue to be equipped with high-performance local readers (for a further discussion of this see the description of the application area "eTicketing in public transport"). Areas with low passenger frequencies (rural areas and so on) can be covered using an infrastructure consisting of permanently installed transponders. Registration and validation is performed using passengers' mobile NFC devices, which read these transponders and automatically compare data with the ticketing system.

The description of the application area "NFC-based eTicketing" is based on the use of an NFC carrier medium's active function as a reader in the field of public transport.

As mentioned above, the associated application scenarios in public transport should be considered complementary to those of conventional eTicketing using chip cards. As a consequence, the standards and agreements applied in that field may also be used as a basis for describing this application area.

European standardisation authorities have so far introduced three standards to support the emerging IFM systems:

- 1 The functional system architecture and the application scenarios of IFM systems are described in the standard ISO EN 24014-1. This standard was drawn up by the CEN TC 278 WG3 SG5 Work Group.
- 2 The description of the data elements to be used in the medium, and the structure of the data elements (application), are discussed in CEN TC 224 WG11 SG1.
- 3 The EN 1545 standard describes the data elements and EN 15320 describes the data structuring (IOPTA, InterOperable Public Transport Application).

In practice we can expect that, in addition to local implementations of eTicketing in public transport, complementary developments will emerge involving NFC-based eTicketing.

The VDV Core Application (CA) gathers together the existing international system standards into one overall set of technical system specifications.

# <span id="page-13-1"></span><span id="page-13-0"></span>**2 Description of services, products and carrier media**

This discussion of products and carrier media intends initially â as also does IOPTA â to delineate the current and predicted state of affairs in Europe. However, emphasis will be placed on the check-in/check-out variation of the CA (CICO), since this is the most highly developed, powerful and flexible of the IOPTA application scenarios. In a CICO system, the passenger registers consciously at the beginning of the journey using the medium, and deregisters consciously at the end.

Customers are provided with services by transport companies, and the following products are offered in connection with that by means of eTicketing:

- 1 Electronic tickets (single-ride tickets, day, month, year and network tickets with defined regional validity, and tickets for regional and long-distance travel).
- 2 Multi-ride entitlements (ticket strips, credits).
- 3 Upgrading or loading a multi-ride entitlement with additional individual entitlements.
- 4 Season tickets (automatic fare calculation, CICO, electronic ticket subscription contract).

The products differ in terms of particular features and characteristics:

- 1 Interoperable or non-interoperable usage.
- 2 Value of entitlement:
	- E-ticket approx. â¬1 â¬15,000; e.g. VRR: â¬6,000, DB AG: â¬15,000,
	- Stored value â¦ â¬150
	- Season tickets â¦ >â¬1,000
- 3 Non-transferable personalised, transferable personalised, anonymous.
- 4 Validity in terms of time and region / non-regulated entitlements.
- 5 Charging variations (account entitlements {pre-/postpaid}, credit entitlements, â¦).
- 6 Time of fare calculation (pre-pricing, trip-pricing and post-pricing).

In all this, interoperability is defined as when two or more companies accept an entitlement/product (acceptance terminal interfaces have to be standardised; in the VDV CA this means ISO-14443 and the specified data interfaces) and calculate between themselves which services were used and how the takings are shared out. Every transport company association in Germany now operates like this. From the customer's point of view interoperability means that they can purchase and load their media and season entitlements to travel at different customer contract partners, and use them with different service providers.

Automatic fare calculation requires a check-in at the start of the journey on public transport, and a check-out at the end, and this in turn requires CICO (check-in/check-out) infrastructure. Systems that use access barriers can use these for checking in and out. In systems without access barriers (Germany for example), a CICO infrastructure comprising check-in and check-out terminals must be installed on the platforms and in the vehicles.

Basically, the common products that involve checking and checking out or a validation of an entitlement can also be depicted using active NFC carrier media. We will, however, be placing particular emphasis on the NFC-based CICO variation, which has been defined on the basis of the VDV CA.

The "secure NFC Mobile Device" can be used universally as a carrier medium for use on public transport.

"+" indicates that the function or characteristic must be taken into account for that sales channel

"+" a symbol highlighted in grey denotes developments expected in the future

1 Sale by personnel

Sales through customer centres and sales points involve a direct interaction between the customer and the personnel of the product provider (CCP).

What these sales channels have in common is that the personnel can identify the customer (e.g. identity card) and that payment methods etc. may be used in a flexible way. Differences arise from the various technical possibilities.

NFC Mobile Devices can be initialised if done "over-the-air" via the mobile network. In any event, customer media can be ordered from the customer centre or sales point and sent to the customer's home. Alternatively, the initialised, personalised customer medium can be set aside for collection at the customer centre.

Loading products and entitlements onto existing personalised and non-personalised NFC Mobile Devices can also be done over-the-air via the mobile network. Alternatively, the NFC interface can be used to load entitlements, which requires direct communication between the customer medium and the sales system via a suitable reader. This is already supported in customer centres and local sales points for personalised and nonpersonalised products. Non-personalised products can also be sold offline using Secure Authentication Modules (SAMs).

2 Service centres (Internet or hotline)

The customer submits personal details, the order, and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (website) or a telephone hotline. The availability of the product and, where applicable, seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering from a service centre. Payment is by credit card, direct debit, or similar. Products and customer media are delivered by post or can be made available for collection at a customer centre.

Personal and address information submitted through a website or telephonically is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

#### 3 Internet using card-readers and secure proof of identity (e.g. eID)

In future there may be another way in which customers can register and place orders.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (website). Data relating to the customer's person (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and a secure identity card (electronic identity card, eID). One way of doing this may be the forthcoming electronic Personalausweis (ePA, electronic identity card).

The availability of the product and, where applicable, the choice of seat can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering on the Internet. Payment is by credit card, direct debit, or similar. Products and customer media are delivered by post or can be made available for collection at the venue (sales point, vending machine).

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID are to be considered trustworthy and reliable. Additional checking is not required.

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>**3 Agreements**

## **3.1 Definition of terms**

#### Application area

The area in which the Technical Guidelines are intended to apply; the highest unit in the terminological structure; incorporates one or more applications, the products/services that belong to those applications, and the application scenarios that result from that.

#### Application scenario

A particular way of looking at the application area in terms of the implementation of specific products and services.

#### Operating process

A comprehensive operational procedure in eTicketing. Examples are the sales process, the use of an entitlement, clearing, and so on.

#### Use case

Detailed description of a series of activities that constitute part of an operating process. Examples include initialising a carrier medium and loading an entitlement.

#### Check-in / check-out (CICO)

When using the "automatic fare calculation" product, the passenger must check in at the start of the journey and check out at the end. This requires an appropriate infrastructure, known as a CICO infrastructure. Systems that use access barriers can use these for checking in and out. Otherwise a CICO infrastructure comprising local transponders must be installed on the platforms, at bus stops and in the vehicles.

### Interoperability

Interoperability means that the customer can buy his entitlement from more than one product supplier, pay using the methods agreed on as part of the system, and redeem the entitlement with more than one service provider. The service provider is remunerated for the services provided by the product owner or product supplier, by means of a clearing procedure. Interoperability is required between transport company associations and also between transport companies within such associations. Accounting accuracy is a central aspect of this, since it determines the money received by the service providers. In the past, money was shared out within transport company associations on the basis of traffic flow analyses, statistics and estimates. Technical accounting accuracy can be achieved with the introduction of CICO technology.

### Usage data

The calculation process in the "automatic fare calculation" product is based on data gathered when the customer uses the service. To enable this, the customer checks in at a local transponder using his customer medium and then checks out again when he has finished using the service. The usage data acquired is stored in the recording system and the customer medium. Its reliability is fundamental to the reliable invoicing of customers and to interoperability between service providers.

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>Calculation data

The usage data which is used for accounting purposes is referred to as calculation data. Calculation data contains, for example, information about the entitlement, the product owner, the service provider, and the place and time of check-in and check-out. This data may or may not be able to be assigned to the customer, depending on whether personalised or anonymous entitlement is being used. The calculation data is passed on to the product owner by the service provider, who gathers it at the recording system. The authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the calculation data are extremely important to customers and service providers alike.

### Statistical data

Statistical data provides information about the general use of a product, a line, a vehicle and so on. With an "automatic fare calculation" entitlement, the statistical data can be derived from the usage data. With other products, usage data can be gathered when the entitlement is assessed before entry. Statistical data is stored and utilised in an anonymised and statistically processed form. Statistical data is not used for invoicing customers for services, but rather for the service provider's or product owner's planning purposes, which is why it is only held in anonymised form. Statistical data can, however, be used for a general division of takings between service providers.

## <span id="page-17-1"></span>**3.2 Generic modelling of roles and entities**

![](_page_17_Figure_6.jpeg)

The roles and responsibilities shall be described on the basis of the ISO 24014 standard.

#### **Figure 3â1 Entities in an application area as defined by ISO 24014 (but extended to include customer medium entities)**

ISO 24014 defines entities and assigns roles and responsibilities to them. The implementation for the eTicketing application areas is described in the following:

Actor

An entity that operates in accord with the role assigned to it.

#### Customer

The purchaser of a product and user of the services associated with it. The customer pays money and receives from the product provider an entitlement to use services. This entitlement is redeemed at the service provider.

#### Customer medium

The customer medium is a data carrier in which an electronic entitlement can be stored. The customer medium is held by the customer, and is required by the customer in order to use the entitlement. Other common names for the customer medium are user medium and carrier medium. Examples of customer media include Smart Tickets, chip cards and active and passive NFC Mobile Devices (NMDs). Active NMDs also perform tasks relating to the recording infrastructure and the issue of entitlements.

#### Issuer of customer medium

The issuer of the customer medium configures it for further use. The issuer may market the customer medium through customer media retailers (such as transport companies). Close coordination and a contractual relationship are required between the issuer of the customer medium, the application issuer and the system manager.

#### Provider of customer medium

The provider of the customer medium (e.g. a transport company or mobile phone service provider) markets the customer medium which it has received from the customer medium issuer. The provider of the customer medium normally implements an application as well when issuing the customer medium.

#### Application

The application supports one or more products by providing functions and structures â such as those needed to store entitlements on the carrier medium, in the sales system and in the backend system. The implementation follows the application specification, which normally belongs to the issuer of the application. The issuer of the application may market the application through application providers (such as a regional transport association). As well as the products, the application may also contain customer-specific information.

#### Application issuer

The application issuer is the owner of the application specification. The application issuer may market the application through application providers (e.g. a transport company).

#### Application provider

The application provider (e.g. a transport company or stadium operator) implements and markets the application which it has received from an application issuer (e.g. in licensed form). The application provider also normally issues the carrier medium in conjunction with implementing the application, making him, for instance, the contractual partner to the customer in the eTicketing application area.

#### Product/entitlement/service

The product is a service or object provided by a product owner and which the customer can use in return for payment. The product belongs to the product owner (e.g. a concert organiser) and is offered to customers directly or through a product provider (e.g. travel agent or advance ticket office). When he purchases the product, the customer receives an entitlement to use a service, which he can then redeem at the service provider (e.g. a transport company).

#### Product owner

The owner of the product (e.g. a single entry to a Bundesliga football match). The

<span id="page-19-0"></span>product owner defines and markets the product, sometimes through a product provider (e.g. an advance ticket office). In simple scenarios, however, it is quite normal for the product owner to be the product provider as well. The product owner must follow the specifications of the application issuer when he defines his product, in order to ensure that the application can support the product. Furthermore, close collaboration is required between the product owner and the service provider who is to provide the service promised by the product. A contractual relationship is required between the product owner, product provider and service provider.

#### Product provider

Markets the product on behalf of the product owner in return for a fee. The product provider receives the customer's payment and is therefore the only interface for payments. This demands direct coordination and a contractual relationship with the product owner. The product provider places the product (e.g. an entitlement) into the application on the carrier medium. The product provider is the contractual partner to the customer in terms of the entitlements he has purchased to utilise services. In organisational terms the product owner often takes on the role of product provider as well.

#### Service provider

Examples include stadium operators and public transport companies; provides the customer with a service if he presents an entitlement purchased from a product provider (e.g. entry to a stadium). This requires direct coordination and a contractual relationship with the product provider and product owner.

#### System manager

The system manager ensures that the rules of the system are upheld. To this end he draws on the functional entities of security manager and registrar.

#### Registrar

The registrar ensures that unique identifying characteristics are allocated throughout the system. This is necessary in order to clearly identify the entities, carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

### Security manager

Establishes and coordinates the security regulations in the system; responsible for approving the components of the system; monitors the performance of security-related functions (e.g. key management).

## <span id="page-19-1"></span>**3.3 Allocation of roles and entities in the "eTicketing for public transport" application area**

Making the services available which are described in Chapter [2](#page-13-1) demands, in a fully developed configuration, the interaction of diverse and changing entities. For instance, it must be made possible for a service provider to handle products from various different product owners and providers, and to support the invoicing accordingly.

The assignment of entities in this application area is identical to the generic description in section [3.2](#page-17-1). In the following diagram, the main entities defined in the VDV Core Application are also shown to provide an example:

<span id="page-20-0"></span>![](_page_20_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 3â2 Entities in the "eTicketing for public transport" application area** 

<span id="page-20-1"></span>The specifications of the VDV Core Application combine some of the roles together:

- 1 The customer contract partner (CCP) takes on the role of providing the application and product. In certain cases, preconfigured NFC Mobile Device can also be issued as customer media together with applications and entitlements.
- 2 VDV KA GmbH takes on the roles of system manager (including security manager and registrar) and application issuer.

Given these facts, the generic diagram in [Figure 3â2](#page-20-1) is modified to produce the following specific plan:

![](_page_20_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 3â3 Entities in the "VDV Core Application" application scenario** 

## **3.4 Relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements**

The model described in sections [3.2](#page-17-1) and [3.3](#page-19-1) supports several product providers, service providers, application issuers and so on.

<span id="page-21-0"></span>This means that a large number of different carrier media, applications and products would be conceivable.

The customer or carrier medium is the customer's data carrier on which he stores his entitlements and with the help of which he makes use of the associated services.

Applications provide the structures and functions required to load entitlements onto carrier media, and to make use of the entitlements. The implementation of applications must therefore take account of the features of specific carrier media and entitlements.

The customer can exchange entitlements for services at the service provider.

The following rules apply to the relationships between carrier media, applications and entitlements:

- 1 A carrier medium can contain at least one application. If more than one application can be stored on it, then it is referred to as a multi-application-compatible carrier medium.
- 2 An application can store at least one entitlement. The VDV Core Application simultaneously supports different entitlements of different types, which may originate from different product providers. Personal data and check-in / check-out data may also be stored in the application.
- 3 Applications on one carrier medium can originate from different application issuers and providers.
- 4 Entitlements in one application may originate from different product owners and providers.
- 5 Entitlements of the same type can be stored in different applications.

The following diagram illustrates an example of the relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements.

![](_page_21_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 3â4 Carrier media, applications and entitlements** 

# <span id="page-22-1"></span><span id="page-22-0"></span>**4 General requirements**

The requirements which must be met by the system as a whole and its processes and components can be divided into three categories.

## **4.1 Function**

## **4.1.1 Customer requirements**

Below are some of the features which are required from the customer's point of view:

- The customer media and systems must be easy to use.
- The customer medium must be durable and reliable, and must perform at the required speed.
- The entitlement and the customer medium must be easy and reliable to use, including with different service providers.
- The way "automatic fare calculation" products are invoiced must be reliable and easy to follow.
- It should be possible to replace lost entitlements for an administration fee. The same should apply to exchanging entitlements.
- It must also be possible to purchase anonymous entitlements.
- Reasonable protection must be provided for personal data (where applicable).

Whenever contact-less chip technology is used, the customer should always be kept properly informed of the personal data used, how it is employed, what is done to protect the data, and any risks that remain.

## **4.1.2 Requirements of the product provider and service provider**

Functionality

- It should be easy to explain to customers and personnel how the customer medium and systems are used.
- The way the system components and processes are executed must take into account the conditions particular to public transport. For example, permanent data access to the overall system cannot be guaranteed in vehicles, so it has to be possible to purchase entitlements, redeem them, check-in / check-out and monitor entitlements even when the terminals involved are not online during the entire process.
- It must be possible to blacklist personalised entitlements and customer media, and to issue replacements.
- Access barriers and check-in/check-out systems must allow enough people through in a given period.

Technical compatibility

â¢ The compatibility of system components must be assured even if carrier media, systems and components come from different manufacturers and providers and are used with different service providers.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**4.2 Economy**

For an eTicketing system to be operated economically, the commercial benefit must be greater than the cost of the processes, systems and security, regardless of how extensively the system is installed. This must apply to all of the entities who invest in the setting-up of the system.

The system as a whole, and its components, should therefore be designed such that the requirements of the relevant application scenarios are met as efficiently as possible. For this reason it is necessary to begin by defining these requirements as accurately as possible.

## **4.3 Security**

This document will deal with the requirements of security separately, from section [8.2](#page-55-1) onwards.

# <span id="page-24-0"></span>**5 Method of determining security requirements**

## **5.1 Objectives**

The Technical Guidelines on secure use of RFID should fulfil the following objectives:

- Provide system suppliers and system users with an introductory guide on the correct implementation of specific RFID system solutions, in terms of safety, information security and privacy.
- Raise awareness of and achieve transparency in aspects of security.
- Provide a basis for the system supplier's or operator's declaration of conformity, and for the issuing of quality seals by certification authorities.

The following information is required in order to achieve these aims:

- A definition of the security requirements that must be fulfilled by an RFID system for a given application area.
- A description of the specific risks, appropriate counter-measures, and potential remaining risks.
- A definition of the criteria for a declaration of conformity and for certification.

It is not just security aspects that are relevant to the definition of activities and proposed systems; all of the requirements described in Chapter [4](#page-22-1) also have to be taken into consideration.

## **5.2 Method**

## **5.2.1 Scope of system considerations**

RFID-based systems can be very complex. In most cases, a lot of components not equipped with RFID are part of the system solution. On the other hand it is not sufficient to look only at the media/tags and readers in order to safeguard the system's security.

The Technical Guidelines must cover in detail every aspect of security relevant to RFID. These aspects depend a lot on the application area and the way the system solution is implemented in it. These Technical Guidelines therefore contain detailed descriptions of the application area and the related operational processes (including the sales channels and processes). Based on this information, use cases are identified that are relevant to RFID. Processes and use cases cover the entire life-cycle of a carrier medium or transponder. On the basis of these processes, use cases are defined that are relevant to the security considerations of the RFID system. These use cases are then used as a basis for the identification of threats, and for a detailed system-specific security assessment of RFID-related parts of the system. [Figure 5â1](#page-25-1) shows this approach for the example of eTicketing in public transport.

<span id="page-25-0"></span>![](_page_25_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](_page_25_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-25-1"></span>All the other system components are considered only in a fairly general manner. Proposed safeguards follow conventional, open standards of IT security.

This concept focuses on those parts of the system that are relevant to RFID, yet still makes sure that all aspects of security are considered. At the same time, the Technical Guidelines leave room for individual and proprietary IT implementations (back-offices, sales systems, logistic systems and so on), which supports the enhancement of existing systems using RFID technology.

## **5.2.2 Scalability and flexibility**

These Technical Guidelines are intended to address security issues primarily. At the same time, any system based on these Guidelines must be economically viable. This means that the following requirements have to be covered by the Guidelines' approach:

- 1 It must be possible to scale systems in such a way that the costs and benefits are balanced. This means in practice that precautionary measures must be proportional to the need for protection. For example: if only low-cost products are used, which require relatively little protection, then precautions should be designed accordingly. This may allow the use of low-cost media, reducing in turn the cost of implementation and operation of the system.
- 2 The application scenarios that have been chosen for the Technical Guidelines cover a wide range, from small to nationwide and even international systems. It is important that the concept discussed in the Guidelines can be used for system solutions of any size and complexity.
- 3 In many cases a system solution can be made economically viable much more easily if you are able to cooperate with other companies. This applies in particular to eTicketing applications, where it can be very beneficial if media already available to customers

<span id="page-26-0"></span>(such as multi-application cards and NFC-enabled phones) can be used for additional applications, products and related services.

The following diagrams provide examples of eTicketing for the cross-system and crossapplication utilisation of customer media and infrastructure.

[Figure 5â2](#page-26-1) shows that various products and application scenarios may have to be supported in one system. Furthermore, these products may be hosted by various types of carrier media.

![](_page_26_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_26_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5â2 Example of application scenarios and RFID-relevant use cases for eTicketing in public transport**

<span id="page-26-1"></span>[Figure 5â3](#page-26-2) gives an example of a customer medium for eTicketing that supports applications from two application areas.

![](_page_26_Figure_8.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5â3 Hierarchical concept for media, applications and entitlements in eTicketing**

<span id="page-26-2"></span>The following concept is used in these Technical Guidelines in order to address the aforementioned requirements:

- 1 A feasible role model and the structure of certain key components (products, applications and media) are defined in Chapter 3. These models support a scalable, extendable approach.
- 2 The Technical Guidelines have to offer security concepts that cover every combination of application scenarios and media used in an infrastructure. This is achieved by individual security assessments based on the RFID-relevant use cases.
- <span id="page-27-0"></span>3 Identical application areas (in particular in eTicketing) that provide opportunities for cross-application partnerships will be addressed by the respective Technical Guidelines with as much communality as possible. The security assessments are based on similar security objectives, and the safeguards make use of the same mechanisms wherever possible.
- 4 A special challenge to system security exists in partnerships across systems and applications. It must be ensured that the security of one system is not undermined by the weaknesses of another. Normally this requires extensive security assessments in both systems.

The Technical Guidelines address this problem by introducing a scalable and transparent concept for employing safeguards against the identified threats; these are called "protection demand categories". A total of three categories from 1 (normal demand) to 3 (very high demand) are applied. All of the safeguards are divided accordingly into three levels, from normal to advanced protection.

For every individual system implementation, the protection demand category will be defined to begin with, for every security target. These findings will be used to select the appropriate level for the safeguards involved.

This concept provides an easy way to establish secure system cooperation. It remains only to ensure that the protection demand categories of both systems match up.

#### **Table 5â1 Structure of the Technical Guidelines**

### <span id="page-28-1"></span>**5.2.4 Explanation of the security concept**

Each set of Technical Guidelines contains examples of how security assessments should be applied to particular application scenarios. These can be adapted to the requirements and peripheral conditions of the particular system implementation in hand.

[Figure 5â4](#page-28-2) shows the security assessment concept used in all of the Technical Guidelines.

## **6.1 Process P1 "registering and ordering"**

### **6.1.1 Setting up a customer account, purchasing personalised customer media and entitlements**

To set up a customer account and purchase a personalised or non-personalised entitlement, the customer applies to the product provider (or the customer contract partner in the VDV Core Application). If the customer does not possess a carrier medium containing a suitable application, then he can purchase one from the product provider[1](#page-30-0) . To facilitate this, the product provider works together with the providers of the application and the customer medium.

Purchasing customer-related entitlements, applications and carrier media requires that the customer registers. To do this the customer provides the necessary personal information (e.g. name, postal address, payment information) and orders the product required.

It is normally up to the product provider to decide which information is required of the customer for the purposes of determining his identity and address and conducting a credit check.

Let us examine the following processes as examples of registering and ordering:

1 Ordering at a customer centre or a local sales point

The customer visits the sales point (e.g. the customer centre of a transport company, a sales point at a railway station or a travel agent), and orders the product. Assuming the payment is not to be made after the service has been provided (post-paid), then it is made there and then. Ideally, the sales point can load the application onto the customer medium and issue them on the spot. If not, they are delivered by post. Personal data is only required if a customer-specific product or a product with a CA payment method by direct debit is ordered, or if postal delivery is required.

Where necessary, identity and personal data are checked by means such as an identity card.

2 Service centre

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by fax, written application or telephone. The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by telephone. Assuming the payment is not to be made after the service has been provided (post-paid), then it is made by credit card, direct debit, etc. The initialised customer media, and the product where relevant, are delivered by post.

Personal and address information submitted by fax or phone is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

<sup>1</sup> The case of a customer who only wants to purchase a customer medium with an application, but no product, is considered irrelevant and is not discussed here.

3 Internet

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by Internet (website). The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Assuming the payment is not to be made after the service has been provided (post-paid), then it is made by credit card, direct debit, etc. The initialised customer media, and the product where relevant, are delivered by post.

Personal and address information submitted via the Internet is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

4 Internet using card-readers and secure proof of identity (e.g. eID)

In future there may be another way for customers to register and place orders.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (website). Personal data (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and a secure electronic identity card.

The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is by credit card, by direct debit, etc.

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID are to be considered trustworthy and reliable. Additional checking is not required.

If a customer medium is ordered, then this is delivered by post.

If the customer already owns a suitable NFC Mobile Device, then he must stipulate its specifications in order to enable the application to be loaded. The application and the entitlement can be downloaded using the NFC Mobile Device's Internet connection.

The following diagram, [Figure 6â1](#page-32-1), shows Process P1A "purchasing personalised customer media and entitlements"

<span id="page-32-0"></span>![](_page_32_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 6â1 Process P1A "purchasing personalised customer media and entitlements"** 

<span id="page-32-1"></span>A customer account can be created and the order placed separately from one another. The customer account is set up once, and all subsequent orders can be placed using that account. In such cases, secure authentication is required in order to access the customer account.

## **6.1.2 Purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements**

Anonymous sales and the sale of non-personalised products are especially important in public transport. In such cases, customer accounts are not set up, and existing customer accounts are not used. The product is supplied on a non-personalised carrier medium or loaded anonymously onto an existing customer card.

Purchasing non-personalised products precludes the possibility of payment by direct debit.

If a product is used which involves determining the journey price after the journey has commenced (e.g. the VDV Core Application), then a pre-paid solution must be used for payment. This can involve an anonymous payment function or a special credits memory on the carrier medium.

The customer must always pay before using the product, or, if the price is determined automatically, he must ensure he has sufficient credit to pay for the transport service he is using. <span id="page-33-0"></span>Anonymous sales require that payment is made immediately, and that the carrier medium can be initialised and taken away by the customer. Non-personalised entitlements are generated on site, and loaded onto existing or new customer media. Payment is made in cash, by card, or using an anonymous pre-paid process.

The following sales channels can be used:

1 Sales point/customer centre, travel agent

In the future, non-personalised customer media will be able to be produced on site, and non-personalised entitlements and credits loaded onto existing customer media. Payment is in cash or by card.

2 Vending machine

The sale of tickets by vending machines is common practice for paper tickets. In future it will be possible for vending machines to generate non-personalised entitlements and load them via the NFC interface onto NFC Mobile Devices that have already been suitably initialised. Payment is in cash or by card.

When using entitlements with automatic fare calculation, pre-paid credits can be loaded onto the device at the vending machine (e.g. into a credits memory).

3 Internet

Non-personalised entitlements can be purchased and paid for over the Internet and loaded onto existing customer media. Payment is using a pre-paid process or by card. Both of these applications can be incorporated into an NFC Mobile Device.

Pre-paid credit can also be loaded over the Internet.

The following diagram shows Process P1B, purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements:

**Figure 6â2 Process P1B "purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"** 

## <span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>**6.2 Process P2 "producing and delivering products"**

### **6.2.1 Process P2A "producing and delivering personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

Two basic cases are to be considered when describing this process:

- 1 Producing and delivering an entitlement together with a specially produced carrier medium.
- 2 Loading an entitlement onto a customer-related NFC Mobile Device already in the possession of the customer.

The following diagram, [Figure 6â3](#page-34-1), shows Process P2A with 4 sub-processes representing the possible ways in which a product may be delivered.

![](_page_34_Figure_7.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6â3 Process P2A "producing and delivering personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

<span id="page-34-1"></span>In Processes P2A.1 to P2A.3, the entitlement ordered is delivered to the customer on a special carrier medium.

In Process P2A.4 it is assumed that the customer already has a suitable NFC Mobile Device.

The customer medium is used in the first instance to identify and authenticate the customer electronically. If the customer medium does not contain a suitable application, then one must be loaded onto it before the entitlement is loaded on.

### <span id="page-35-0"></span>**6.2.2 Process P2B "producing and delivering non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

Two basic cases are to be considered when describing this process:

- 1 Producing and delivering an entitlement together with a specially issued NFC Mobile Device.
- 2 Loading an entitlement onto a customer-related NFC Mobile Device already in the possession of the customer.

The following diagram, [Figure 6â4](#page-35-1), shows Process P2B with 3 sub-processes representing the possible ways in which a product may be delivered

![](_page_35_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6â4 Process P2B "producing and delivering non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

<span id="page-35-1"></span>In Process P2B.1, the application and entitlement ordered are delivered to the customer on a special carrier medium. Provided data that can be related to a person is clearly separated on the carrier medium and application, then a non-personalised entitlement can be loaded onto a personalised carrier medium.

In Process P2B.2 it is assumed that the customer already has a suitable NFC Mobile Device. If the device does not contain a suitable application, then one must be loaded onto it before the entitlement is loaded on.

Process P2B.3 is the same as P2B.2, except that applications cannot be loaded onto the carrier medium. The customer medium must be fully configured to accept the entitlement as a precondition for the customer to use this process.

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>**6.3 Process P3 "using an entitlement"**

The entitlement is redeemed by the customer in exchange for a service. The customer must have a carrier medium with an approved application and valid entitlement in order to use the transport.

The CICO infrastructure (tags) and electronic inspection infrastructure are the responsibility of the service provider. The service provider must first do a number of things so as to guarantee the operation of this function:

- 1 The local tag infrastructure must be adapted to the applications and entitlements that are being used.
- 2 The specific key information for reading the entitlements and writing the usage data must be integrated into the recording system's and inspection equipment's key management systems, as well as for the tags to be personalised.
- 3 The list of blocked entitlements (the blacklist) must be transferred from the ticket system into the inspection infrastructure, which requires the approval and installation of a realtime data interface between the product provider's ticket system and the service provider's inspection infrastructure.

When checking in, the entitlement has to be checked. If an "automatic fare calculation" product is being used, then the user must also check out at the end of the journey. At both these points, data relating to the fare is stored in the ticket system and the carrier medium.

When using an automatic fare calculation product (e.g. the Touch&Travel project), then the customer checks in by registering at a stationary tag, which may be installed on the platform or bus stop, for instance. The NFC Mobile Device works in active mode. The tags contain unique location information which, when checking in, is retrieved in secure, non-manipulable form, and sent on to the central recording system, where the actual check-in is completed.

Stationary tags can also be used for activating conventional entitlements (e.g. ticket strips) before beginning a journey.

It cannot be assumed that there will be a constant Internet connection in a vehicle. To enable inspection in the vehicle, check-in data is stored in secure form on the carrier medium before beginning the journey. As soon as this data is on the NFC Mobile Device, the customer is informed by a message on the display that he has checked in successfully or that the entitlement has been activated. Under normal circumstances the customer may not begin the journey until this has happened.

The inspection terminals in the vehicle must also work offline. The NFC Mobile Device behaves in the same way as a passive carrier medium when being inspected using an inspection medium.

Other scenarios are possible in which the inspector uses an "inspection card", a type of passive chip card, in which case the NFC Mobile Device works actively.

The following diagram shows Process P3:

<span id="page-37-0"></span>![](_page_37_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 6â5 Process P3 "using a CICO entitlement"** 

Fault cases are not dealt with here.

## **6.4 Process P4 "blacklisting entitlements, applications and carrier media"**

It is possible to blacklist entitlements, applications and carrier media securely using chipbased carrier media. This helps the processes of cancelling and exchanging carrier media and entitlements, and enables lost media to be replaced. The following are possible scenarios:

- 1 Defective carrier media are withdrawn. Before issuing a replacement medium it is important to ascertain that a counterfeit has not been presented for replacement, and that a medium has not been declared as defective and submitted.
- 2 In practice, mislaid carrier media can only be blacklisted and replaced if they are personalised and assigned to a customer account (see registration) with a product provider. If this is the case, then the owner can identify himself to the product provider from which he obtained the medium, and state which carrier medium is to be blacklisted. The same procedure can be used to cancel entitlements.
- 3 Mislaid personalised carrier media and the entitlements stored on them can be replaced provided that all the applications and entitlements on them have been blacklisted. It is important to remember that the carrier medium may contain more than one application, and that these may themselves contain entitlements from various product issuers and providers.

# <span id="page-39-1"></span><span id="page-39-0"></span>**7 Use cases**

The following sections contain descriptions of use cases that are relevant as we look further at contact-less chip technology in this application area. These use cases have been derived from the generic operating processes described in Chapter [6](#page-30-1).

The descriptions of the use cases are based on an illustrative system architecture which is discussed in more detail in Chapter [10](#page-112-1).

## **7.1 Use case the "Identification when registering and ordering"**

The quality of the process of authenticating and identifying the customer is crucial to the reliability of the data upon which Process P1, "Registering and ordering", is based. Process descriptions P1A.1 â P1A.4 can be used for elucidating this. Using a reliable process, such as one involving a secure personalised customer medium or an electronic identification medium (e.g. an eID), will mean an increase in security and functionality.

## <span id="page-39-2"></span>**7.2 Use case the "Carrier medium initialisation"**

The "Carrier medium initialisation" use case depicted in [Figure 7â1](#page-40-1) incorporates the following steps:

- 1 Carrier medium initialisation
	- a Default settings relating to function and security
	- b Setting specific keys
	- c Setting an ID which uniquely identifies the carrier medium
- 2 Loading the applications
	- a Loading the software specific to the applications concerned
	- b Allocating the resources of the carrier medium (setting up file systems and so on)
	- c Setting specific keys for each application
	- d Setting the validity of the application
- 3 Loading the application-specific data
	- a Loading customer data (where required)
	- b Loading the ID of the application provider

As the stages of initialising the carrier medium progress, the information in the management system for carrier media and applications has to be updated.

The various keys, certificates and so on that are used are generated and fed in by a key management system. This system is the responsibility of the system manager (more precisely the security manager and registrar). If the carrier medium's chip is to generate public keys during initialisation, then these also have to be fed into the key management system.

<span id="page-40-0"></span>![](_page_40_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â1 Use case "Carrier medium initialisation"** 

<span id="page-40-1"></span>Carrier medium initialisation normally takes place in a secure environment (e.g. in a mass personaliser or in a vending machine).

However, NFC Mobile Devices can also be initialised and applications loaded onto them in any location â i.e. over-the-air. This use case is therefore especially important.

## <span id="page-40-2"></span>**7.3 Use case the "Application loading"**

The "Application loading" use case shown in [Figure 7â2](#page-41-1) illustrates the procedure for loading an application onto an NFC Mobile Device already in the possession of a customer.

<span id="page-41-0"></span>![](_page_41_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â2 Use case "Application loading"** 

<span id="page-41-1"></span>There are various possible scenarios for loading a new application onto an existing carrier medium:

- 1 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in a trustworthy environment.
- 2 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in an insecure environment. For instance, this may occur when loading an application via a reader on a home computer or in an advance ticket office.
- 3 Loading an application "over-the-air" onto an NFC Mobile Device.

When loading the application via the Internet, the process stage "carrier medium in reading area" is replaced by the setting-up of a protected connection between the NFC Mobile Device and the application provider's server.

## <span id="page-41-2"></span>**7.4 Use case the "Entitlement loading"**

As soon as the carrier medium has been initialised and the applications installed, entitlements can be loaded onto the applications.

The sale of products is directly dependent on this use case being performed securely and in a way which is easy for customers. The use case is therefore an absolutely crucial one for providers and customers alike. All of the sales channels discussed in the descriptions of Processes P2A and P2B (Section [6.2](#page-34-2)) must be taken into consideration when dealing with the "Entitlement loading" use case depicted in [Figure 7â3](#page-42-1).

<span id="page-42-0"></span>![](_page_42_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â3 Use case "Entitlement loading"** 

<span id="page-42-1"></span>A distinction must be made between the loading of entitlements when the carrier medium is first issued and the loading of entitlements later on. With NFC Mobile Devices, the latter is normally done over-the-air. However, it is also possible to load entitlements via contact-less interfaces at sales points and vending machines.

When loading entitlements via the Internet, the process stage "carrier medium in reading area" is replaced by the setting-up of a protected connection between the NFC Mobile Device and the product provider's server.

## **7.5 Use case the "Delivery"**

Carrier media that have been initialised and loaded with entitlements must then be passed to the delivery point or the customer as described in P2A.1, P2A.2 and P2B. 1.

When delivering, the product provider must also record security-relevant information about the delivery in the ticket system. This includes:

- 1 Addressee,
- 2 ID of carrier media, ID of entitlements,
- 3 Sender,
- 4 Delivery point, special arrangements relating to handing-over.

During evaluation, potential threats (such as theft and cloning, etc.) should be stated and assessed for the various application scenarios.

## <span id="page-43-0"></span>**7.6 Use case the "Check-in"**

The "Check-in" use case represents the first part of Process P3.2 in detail.

Checking in or activating the entitlement, and checking out, are done using an infrastructure of permanently installed local transponders (tags), which contain location information or indicators thereof. The local transponders are usually equipped with a contact-less interface as defined in ISO/IEC14443, and assume the passive role of the PICC defined in that standard. The NFC Mobile Device functions in active mode. If the transponders are tags as defined in ISO/IEC14443, then the NFC Mobile Device functions in "PCD mode" as defined in NFCIP2.

There are basically two methods of implementation, the use of which depends on the requirements of the system being put in place:

- 1 In cases in which the process time is non-critical and in which an Internet connection is sure to be available, the check-in can be performed online in direct communication between the backend system's server and the tag, once the connection has been established via the NFC Mobile Device.
- 2 If checking in has to be performed within a limited time, then it makes sense to divide the process up into a number of stages, in which data is stored temporarily on the NMD.

The second case covers all of the requirements of checking in and activating entitlements on public transport, including under difficult conditions, for which reason it shall be described here.

The following diagram shows the procedure. The exact way this is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>![](_page_44_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â4 Use case "Offline check-in"** 

<span id="page-44-1"></span>The following special variations of this use case must be given particular attention when setting up the system and considering its security aspects:

- 1 If a non-personalised entitlement of the "automatic fare calculation" type is being used, then a non-personal payment procedure (e.g. a credits memory) must also be used. Before the journey begins the system must check whether the customer has sufficient credit, and it must be possible to deduct the right amount when checking out.
- 2 It is conceivable that the evaluation of entitlements, credit levels, and information retrieved from the local transponder, which is done in the backend system, ends in failure. It is also conceivable that the backend system cannot write the check-in information back to the application on the NFC Mobile Device as a result of failures (no mobile network, NMD battery empty).

## <span id="page-45-0"></span>**7.7 Use case the "Entitlement check"**

The "Entitlement check" use case represents the technical process of a ticket inspector checking the customer's entitlement to travel. The NFC Mobile Device functions in passive mode, and behaves in the same way as a contact-less chip card. The exact way the process is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

An entitlement check is normally performed using a mobile inspector's terminal loaded with the necessary SAM and blacklists.

![](_page_45_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7â5 Use case "Entitlement check"**

If a fault occurs, the entitlement is normally checked visually.

<span id="page-46-0"></span>Where necessary, information needed to check and calculate the fare is written to the application after successful inspection.

## **7.8 Use case the "Offline check-out"**

The "Offline check-out" use case represents the second part of Process P3.2 in detail.

In terms of its procedure, the "offline check-out" use case is the same as the "offline checkin" use case shown in [Figure 7â4](#page-44-1). If automatic fare calculation is being used, then the final or preliminary data is determined for calculation instead of the check-in data.

The data used for invoicing which may have been sent to the application in the NFC Mobile Device during the inspection process is also retrieved and used for calculating the fare.

## **7.9 Use case the "Blocking"**

Carrier media that have been mislaid must be blacklisted. The same applies to defective media and entitlements, assuming they cannot be withdrawn and destroyed.

The blacklisting of a medium and/or the entitlement stored on it is a precondition for the issuing of a replacement medium, or for the transfer of an entitlement to a new owner with a different customer medium.

Blocking can only be performed if it is sufficiently certain that the customer requesting it is the rightful owner of the medium or entitlement. That is why customers may only blacklist media or entitlements in either of the following cases:

- 1 The customer's details were stored when purchasing. Blacklisting is then performed following reliable identification and a legally binding declaration that the customer agrees to the procedure.
- 2 The medium containing the entitlement is presented. Its authenticity can be determined securely.

As well as customers performing blacklisting, other entities in the system can apply for it too. To this end, responsibilities and processes are defined for these entities in the system as a whole. It must be defined which entities may blacklist entitlements, applications and media, and under what circumstances. The same applies to the transfer of applications and entitlements onto other media.

<span id="page-47-0"></span>![](_page_47_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â6 Use case "Blocking"** 

## **7.10 Use cases the "Key management"**

For performance reasons, entitlements on carrier media are usually protected using procedures involving symmetric keys. The security and proper function of the system as a whole is therefore highly dependent on the secure provision and storage of the keys, a job which has to be done by the key management system and the processes assigned to it.

In the following use cases, Secure Authentication Modules (SAMs) are used as secure storage for key information, security mechanisms and diversification algorithms. In principle, other methods may also be feasible.

Carrier medium initialisation and the loading of entitlements require a key management system that recognises the hierarchical relationship between carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

## **7.10.1 Key management for the initialisation of carrier media**

[Figure 7â7](#page-48-1) illustrates the use case of key management for the initialisation of carrier media. The keys and procedures defined here are also required for the loading of applications.

<span id="page-48-0"></span>![](_page_48_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â7 Use case "Key management for carrier media"** 

## <span id="page-48-2"></span><span id="page-48-1"></span>**7.10.2 Key management for loading and personalising applications**

In order to secure applications that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the applications.

[Figure 7â8](#page-49-1) shows the corresponding use cases. The key management system for carrier media also has to be available when the application is loaded onto the carrier medium.

<span id="page-49-0"></span>![](_page_49_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â8 Use case "Key management for applications"** 

## <span id="page-49-2"></span><span id="page-49-1"></span>**7.10.3 Key management for loading entitlements**

In order to secure entitlements that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the products.

[Figure 7â9](#page-50-1) shows the corresponding use cases. The key management system for applications also has to be available when the entitlement is loaded onto the application.

## <span id="page-50-1"></span>**7.10.4 Key management for use with the service provider**

Providers and issuers require a key management system to initialise carrier media, load applications and issue entitlements.

The public transport service provider requires the keys and other information necessary to read and evaluate entitlements.

This information has to be available in the inspection system.

To this end, the security manager normally generates and issues specific SAMs (service provider SAMs) for the service provider using the key management system. Service provider SAMs can contain key information from multiple providers of products, applications and carrier media. A selection is put together by the security manager in accordance with the needs of the service provider.

## <span id="page-50-2"></span>**7.11 Use case the "Initialising local transponders"**

In systems that make use of the active functionality of the NFC interface, the local transponder (tag) performs certain functions otherwise provided by a conventional reader infrastructure. Basically this means that a locally installed transponder is subject to threats similar to those affecting a reader.

The "initialise local transponder" use case depicted in [Figure 7â10](#page-52-1) covers the following stages:

- 1 Local transponder initialisation
	- a Default settings relating to function and security
	- b Setting specific keys
	- c Setting an ID which uniquely identifies the transponder
	- d Updating key information
- 2 Loading the applications
	- a Loading the software specific to the applications concerned
	- b Allocating the resources of the transponder (setting up file systems and so on)
	- c Setting specific keys for each application
	- d Setting the validity of the application
- 3 Loading the application data
	- a Loading customer data (where required)
	- b Loading the ID of the application provider

As the stages of initialising the local transponder progress, the information in the management system for carrier media and applications has to be updated.

The various keys, certificates and so on that are used are generated and fed in by a key management system. This system is the responsibility of the system manager (more precisely the security manager and registrar). If the carrier medium's chip is to generate public keys during initialisation, then these also have to be fed into the key management system.

Local transponder initialisation normally takes place in a secure environment (e.g. in a mass personaliser).

## **8.1 Definitions relating to security and privacy**

Security can be divided into three aspects or categories, all of which this document intends to examine. They are:

- Safety
- Information security
- Privacy

These categories can be subdivided as follows:

1 Safety

Safety is not to be confused with reliability/correctness or quality of service. Reliability means that the system works correctly according to its specifications. Experience shows that every technical system is sometimes subject to failure. Safety is understood as the capacity of a system, when it does fail, not to enter uncontrollable states that would endanger the system itself or its environment (fail-safe). At the same time, the system should also continue to respond as far as possible in compliance with its specification (fault tolerance). Safety, therefore, basically implies protection against unintended incidents.

2 Information security

Unlike safety, information security offers protection against intentional attacks. In the field of information security, security targets can be formulated as belonging to the following categories:

- a Confidentiality: confidentiality means protection against the unauthorised disclosure of information. Confidential data and information may only be accessible to authorised people in an authorised manner. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against access by unauthorised persons.
- b Integrity: integrity means ensuring that data is correct (intact) and that systems function properly. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against unauthorised modification.
- c Availability: the availability of services, of the functions of an IT system, IT applications and IT networks â and also of information â exists if these things are always available to their users when required. Formulated as a protection target this means: information and operating systems are to be protected against being withheld improperly.
- d Unlinkability: if two communication elements within a system are unlinkable, it means they are not any more or less related to one another than is already known and established. Within the system, no further information about the relationship between these communication elements can be obtained. In practical terms this means that a single user can make use of services and resources more than one time, without third parties being able to see that these access events (in the communication model: messages) are related through the user.
- e Unobservability: an event is unobservable if it cannot be determined whether it has happened or not. Sender-unobservability means it cannot be seen that anything has been sent; recipient-unobservability is the same: it is not possible to ascertain

that something has been received. Relationship-unobservability means that it cannot be seen that anything is sent from the group of possible senders to the group of possible recipients.

- f Anonymity: anonymity is the condition of being unidentifiable within one's anonymity group. Using the term unlinkability, anonymity can be more precisely defined as the unlinkability of the identity of a user and an event initiated by that user. Senderanonymity is therefore unlinkability of sender and message, and recipientanonymity is the unlinkability of message and recipient.
- g Authenticity: the term authenticity designates a situation in which the partner in a communication process is actually the person he claims to be. Authentic information is information that genuinely comes from the stated source. The term is not only used when people's identity is being checked, but also for IT components and applications.
- h Non-repudiation: protection should exist against the possibility of denying that messages have been sent and received by persons whose authenticity has been determined.
- i Binding validity: binding validity joins together the IT security targets of authenticity and non-repudiation. When transmitting information this means that the source of the information has proven its identity and that the receipt of the message cannot be disputed.
- 3 Privacy

The purpose of privacy is to protect against infringements of the personal rights of the individual through the handling of his personal data.

Privacy refers to the protection of personal data against possible misuse by third parties (not to be confused with data security).

The following additional terms will also be used throughout:

1 Security targets

Security targets are the security-related and safety-related objectives undertaken when setting up an IT system. This document lays down specific security targets within the areas of use and application scenarios. Infringing upon the security targets causes direct damage to the entity whose security target is violated.

2 Threats

Threats are immediate risks to the security targets of an application.

These may be the result of an active attack on one or more security targets, or they may take the form of potential vulnerabilities in the system such as the lack of a fallback solution.

3 Safeguards

Safeguards are actual recommended actions that counter one or more threats. The safeguards described in this document are intended to be applied meaningfully and according to need, which means they are suggested on the basis of economic feasibility and resistance to manipulation: how expensive is a safeguard, and what are the financial damages that it can limit or prevent?

4 Residual risk

Generally speaking it is not possible to counteract every single threat in such a way that a system offers perfect security. The residual risk is thus the risk of potential attack that remains after a series of safeguards have been put in place. The extent of this risk depends on the counter-measures that can be applied, how complex they are, and, above all, what the costs are in relation to the benefits for the entity involved. The entity has to take explicit liability for the residual risk.

## <span id="page-55-1"></span><span id="page-55-0"></span>**8.2 Definition of the security targets**

It would be very unusual indeed for all of the safety aspects relating to safety, information security and privacy within a given application scenario to be of equal importance, or indeed for every single one of them to be relevant at all. The first challenge when designing a secure RFID system is therefore to formulate specific security targets.

Within the areas of use relating to eTicketing, certain higher level security targets specific to the application area can be recognised, based on the generic security targets mentioned earlier:

- 1 Protection of electronic entitlements (represents the protection targets integrity and authenticity)
- 2 Safety of the RFID system
- 3 Protection of the customer's privacy (represents the protection targets confidentiality, unlinkability, unobservability, anonymity, and privacy as a general requirement)

The lower level security targets listed in Section [8.2.4](#page-60-1) can be derived from the assessments of the entities' security targets contained in the following sections.

**Table 8â20 Threats to the backend systems** 

## <span id="page-71-1"></span>**8.4 Safeguards**

This section describes the safeguards that can be used to counter the threats detailed in Section 8.3. These safeguards are defined in such a way that, when built successively upon each other, they afford increasing levels of security â in cases where different levels are possible. Level 1 represents the lowest security category, level 3 the highest.

Level 3+ is used to denote additional safeguards that increase the security of a system, but whose expense may disproportionately exceed the value of the extra security gained.

The security levels are oriented around the system's protection demand categories. A threat to a security target that has been allocated to protection demand category 3 should be countered by safeguards of security level 3.

The following safeguards are generally not defined as isolated measures, but rather are to be understood as "safeguard packages". As a rule, the security of components and interfaces, and of the system as a whole, can only be increased in a meaningful way if safeguards are employed across the board as packages. Furthermore, alternative possibilities are defined within the security levels; for instance, a secure environment (which generally does not exist) can replace the encrypted storage of data.

<span id="page-72-0"></span>The following table shows the scheme of safeguard or measure codes and used abbreviations.

**Table 8â21 Coding scheme of safeguard measures** 

## **8.4.1 Selection of cryptographic processes**

In the following descriptions of safeguards, cryptographic processes as defined in [ALGK\_BSI] are required for new implementations. [ALGK\_BSI] defines suitable processes, suitable key lengths and the predicted life-span of these processes. [ALGK\_BSI] is revised and published by the BSI at appropriate intervals.

Existing implementations should always satisfy [ALGK\_BSI] or [TR\_eCARD]. In the next evolutionary step of a given implementation, [ALGK\_BSI] should be applied. This step should be taken within an appropriate period of time.

The TDES algorithm may be applied to existing system for authentication, encryption and MAC-formation, given the aforementioned conditions.

## <span id="page-72-1"></span>**8.4.2 Safeguards for the protection of the system as a whole**

The following safeguards relate to the system as a whole, the focus being on the sales, inspection and management systems, including the associated interfaces.

Separate sections will deal with the RF interface; readers installed in terminals, vending machines and so on; carrier media; and the key management system.

|       | The necessary separation of applications requires carrier media that are able to<br>support this separation (security boundaries). To do this the carrier medium<br>must contain an appropriate card management application that is able to proc<br>ess the commands defined in ISO 7816-13. |                   |  |
|       | An application can only be loaded if in the possession of the application pro<br>vider. It should be transferred securely, after checking for version, integrity and<br>authenticity.                                                                                                        |                   |  |

Loading the new application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                   |  |
|       | The process of loading new applications uses command sequences defined in<br>the ISO 7816-13 standard. This standard defines the following commands:<br>â¢<br>Application management request                                                                                                  |                   |  |

|       | The Application management request and Load application commands are<br>therefore required in order to load a new application.                                                                                                                                                               |                   |  |
|       | ISO 7816-13 commands must be executed using secure messaging. This en<br>sures that the new application is authentic when loaded, and can be operated<br>securely. The following section looks more closely at the application of this ISO<br>standard to this use case.                     |                   |  |
|       | Note:<br>New applications can also be loaded without SM. This will not influence the se<br>curity of the existing applications, but it will not secure the authenticity of the<br>new application.                                                                                           |                   |  |
|       | Since the standard ISO7816-13 only provides a general framework in which<br>applications can be loaded onto suitable carrier media, the following specific<br>factors must be taken into account for this use case:                                                                          |                   |  |
|       | â¢<br>Every application must be given an application ID in order to ensure clear<br>separation between the applications.                                                                                                                                                                      |                   |  |
|       | â¢<br>Furthermore, all organisations must be given unique organisation IDs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |  |

### **8.4.5 Safeguards relating to the local transponder during online check-in and check-out**

When checking in online, direct communication between the inspection server and the local transponder is first established via the Internet, using the NFC Mobile Device (active mode). The inspection server controls the reading process, and normally establishes a secure channel through which the transponder data can then be transmitted securely. The NFC Mobile Device does not come into contact with the transponder data.

After reading and evaluating the transponder data, the recording server establishes a secure channel to the NFC Mobile Device's secure memory, checks the entitlement, and writes the check-in or check-out data to the application in the NFC Mobile Device's secure memory.

The recording server stores all of the necessary keys in its SAM.

### **8.4.6 Safeguards relating to the local transponder during offline check-in and check-out**

The major threats to which local transponders are exposed can be countered using the safeguards that apply to passive carrier media. These safeguards are described in Section [8.4.3.](#page-81-1)

This section therefore only describes safeguards that are specially designed for local transponders.

# <span id="page-109-0"></span>**9 Definition of product-specific application scenarios**

We will now examine the processes described in Chapters [6](#page-30-1) and [7](#page-39-1) to provide examples of how particular products can be implemented.

We have chosen the kind of product mix that is common in regional and national public transport.

The following products will be discussed:

- 1 Local multi-ride entitlement (value of max. â¬20, non-interoperable)
- 2 Interoperable fare calculation and multi-application compatibility

The selected application scenarios will be discussed for these products in more detail in Chapter [11](#page-142-1).

## **9.1 Application scenario: "Interoperable, personal season entitlement with automatic fare calculation"**

#### Product

Purchasing this personalised product entitles the customer to utilise any transport service in any area and on any route. The entitlement is interoperable, which means it is valid at all times and with every service provider that supports this special application and product. The customer has to register at the beginning of his journey using his NFC Mobile Device at a local transponder, and check out at the end of the journey. The fare is calculated automatically on the basis of the local fares.

The VDV Core Application provides an example of how this product is implemented. Without having to know the fares or zones, the customer can use the services of any public transport service provider that employs compatible inspection equipment.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value of the entitlement can range from tens of euros to several thousand euros.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media can be employed when using the entitlement:

| Carrier medium        | Usage model                                                                                                                                               | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### **Table 9â1 Carrier media for the use of "Interoperable season entitlement with automatic fare calculation"**

Relevant processes

The normal use case is that of loading an application and an entitlement onto an existing NFC Mobile Device.

However, it is feasible that new NFC Mobile Devices could be issued with these products pre-loaded, so we will also discuss that case as well.

The following processes from Chapter [6](#page-30-1) must be taken into account for each carrier medium:

| Carrier medium | Relevant processes         | Comments                                                                                                                            |

| bile Device    | P2A.1, P2A.2, P2A.3, P2A.4 |                                                                                                                                     |
|                | P3.2                       | Processes P2A.1 â P2A.3 are only<br>relevant if the NFC Mobile Device<br>is supplied initialised and loaded<br>with an entitlement. |

**Table 9â2 Relevant processes** 

Implementation

In this application scenario it is assumed that an online connection to the inspection server only exists temporarily during the check-in and check-out processes. The "offline check-in" and "offline check-out" use cases are therefore discussed.

## **9.2 Application scenario: "Local multi-ride entitlement"**

#### Entitlement

Purchasing the "local multi-ride entitlement" product entitles the customer to multiple use for single journeys on local transport within an association. Interoperability is not required in this case. The entitlement is non-personalised.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value is normally less than â¬20. If this value is exceeded, then appropriate solutions should be used for the components.

### Relevant processes

The normal use case is loading an application and entitlement onto an existing NFC Mobile Device. We do not expect NFC Mobile Devices to be issued pre-loaded with this product, which is why that case will not be discussed.

The following processes from Chapter [6](#page-30-1) must be taken into account for each carrier medium:

**Table 9â4 Relevant processes** 

Implementation

In this application scenario it is assumed that an online connection to the inspection server exists during the entire check-in and check-out processes. The "online check-in" and "online check-out" use cases are therefore discussed.

# <span id="page-112-1"></span><span id="page-112-0"></span>**10 Suggestions on implementing the system as a whole**

This Chapter describes, as an example, the entire system for the "NFC-based eTicketing" application area.

The overall system is made up of the eTicketing infrastructure and the carrier media, i.e. the NFC Mobile Devices. The term eTicketing infrastructure refers collectively to all of the system components and associated interfaces installed by the product providers, service providers and system manager.

The solution presented here can cover the aforementioned role descriptions, processes and application scenarios in their maximum complexity. Variations on it are conceivable in the case of specialised implementations in actual use. In particular, simplification of the role model, and reductions in the number of different media, applications, products, and of the public transport entities involved, would also enable simplifications of the system and the processes.

The focus of these considerations and of the suggestions regarding safeguards is on the implementation of the RF interface and the directly connected components NFC Mobile Device, local transponder and inspection device.

The following diagram shows the system as a whole and its principal components.

#### **Figure 10â1 A schematic example of the "NFC-based eTicketing" system as a whole**

## <span id="page-113-1"></span>**10.1 Suggestions on implementing the eTicketing infrastructure**

## <span id="page-113-2"></span>**10.1.1 Determining the protection demand for the eTicketing infrastructure**

The following general considerations apply to the eTicketing infrastructure, and these should be included when determining the protection requirements:

- 1 The systems in [Figure 10â1](#page-112-2) should simultaneously support a range of different products, as defined in the proposed application scenarios.
- 2 Data relating to particular persons must be managed and processed.
- 3 Usage data will be generated and must be processed.
- 4 Calculation data must be logged and forwarded if "automatic fare calculation" applications and products are to be supported. Interoperability is required.
- 5 The case of interoperability being assured by agreements between the entities can also be examined as an option.

On the basis of the criteria described in Section [8.2.5](#page-61-1), the eTicketing infrastructure can be assigned to the following protection demand categories:

|     | Security target            | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                       |

**Table 10â1 The system's protection requirements** 

## <span id="page-116-0"></span>**10.1.2 Interfaces in the system as a whole**

The system shown in [Figure 10â1](#page-112-2) is reliant on interaction between all the system components. In order to facilitate the business processes described in Chapter [6](#page-30-1), the technical interfaces and operative interaction between the components have to be specified.

Furthermore, agreements must be made between the entities to regulate the responsibilities and the operational procedures.

### **10.1.2.1 Threats relevant to the eTicketing infrastructure**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the security targets used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-113-2)

**Table 10â4 Safeguards for the system as a whole** 

#### **10.1.2.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk relating to the key management system should be determined and documented for the implementation concerned.

### **10.1.3 Readers as defined in ISO/IEC14443**

Conventional readers as defined in ISO/IEC14443 are used for inspecting entitlements in the vehicles.

It is also possible use to an ISO/IEC14443 reader that communicates with the NFC Mobile Device's NFC interface to write entitlements and credits to the NFC Mobile Device's secure memory. In both cases the NFC Mobile Device works in passive mode in the same way as a PICC as defined in ISO/IEC 14443.

Readers control the flow of information for reading from and writing to the carrier medium, using a contact-less communication protocol. The reader (PCD as defined by ISO/IEC14443) assumes the active role (master), while the carrier medium (PICC as defined by ISO/IEC14443) is passive (slave).

Readers are integrated into various system components:

- 1 Sales systems at sales points
- 2 Vending machines
- 3 Service desks
- 4 Mobile inspection units (inspection terminals)

The mobile inspection units must have at least the following features:

- 1 Contact-less read/write unit with interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443 A/B Part 1-4.
- 2 Offline capability.
- 3 Capacity to store all usage data until the next data exchange with the central system.
- 4 Parallel support of multiple carrier media, applications and products (selection using ID).
- 5 Basic cryptographic functions.
- 6 Support for SAMs. Multiple SAM slots should be available.
- 7 The result of the validation should be displayed visually.

In principle the same requirements apply to all other readers, such as those installed in vending machines. Offline capability, however, is not always required.

**Table 10â7 Safeguards for the reader and its applications** 

## **10.1.3.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk relating to the readers should be determined and documented for the implementation concerned.

### <span id="page-123-0"></span>**10.1.4 Sale, inspection and management systems**

#### **10.1.4.1 Sales systems**

Access to the products must be easy and inexpensive for all potential customers, which is why a range of points of sale should be supported. These are described in the following:

#### **Sales point**

This could be, for instance, the office of a transport company (e.g. CA customer contract partner) or a travel agent.

#### Sales procedure

The customer visits the sales point in person and purchases the product there:

- Identification, if required, is by identity card.
- The booking is done in dialogue with the customer at the sales point.
- Payment is made at the sales point.

If the entitlement can be loaded onto an existing customer medium (see "Technical equipment"), then the customer can take the product away with him straight away. If not, then the product and the carrier medium are sent by post or held at the sales point, ready for subsequent collection.

#### Technical equipment

The sales point has direct access to the ticket sales system. This is a precondition for services such as seat reservation.

A simple contact-less reader at the sales point can provide a way of loading entitlements onto an existing customer medium. If such a contact-less reader exists, then in future it could become possible to utilise an electronic proof of identity as a means of securely and automatically transferring personal data into the ticket system (e.g. for setting up a customer account), or for secure identification.

The personnel and IT infrastructure at the sales point are not always trustworthy.

#### **Vending machines**

At vending machines, entitlements are sold and issued in a direct interaction between the vending machine and the customer, or credits levels are topped up anonymously.

Vending machines are installed in customer centres, railway stations, bus and tram stops, and also inside vehicles. They are especially suitable for the anonymous sale of products.

Vending machines that are used in vehicles must be able to work offline. The exchange of data with a sales system is only possible at certain intervals.

In the simplest case, entitlements and credits are written to the NFC Mobile Device via a contact-less reader installed in the vending machine.

The customer purchases or collects the product at a vending machine:

â¢ Booking is done at a vending machine.

- Payment is made directly using methods such as Maestro or credit cards, or using a payment procedure specific to the system.
- The entitlement and/or credit is loaded directly onto the NFC Mobile Device.

#### **Internet, call centres, ordering by post**

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order by telephone, Internet or fax from any location:

- The booking, choice of seat etc. can be made in a direct interaction when using the Internet or telephone. Written orders do not allow this.
- Payment is made by Maestro, credit card or direct debit.
- For secure identification, the personal data sent by the customer and the NFC Mobile Device's key data (contract, technical specifications, etc.) may have to be checked separately.

The loading of applications and entitlements onto an existing NFC Mobile Device can be supported. Loading is done over-the-air. Alternatively, the NFC Mobile Device can be initialised and sent by post together with the required entitlement.

#### Technical equipment

The product provider operates an Internet sales platform or a call centre. The customer does not require any particular technical equipment.

#### **Internet**

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order interactively by Internet from any location (e.g. at home).

If the customer has a customer medium which already contains the necessary application, then the required product can be loaded onto it. In the case of a NFC Mobile Device, this loading is normally done over-the-air:

- Booking, seat reservation and so on can be done in a direct interaction when using the Internet.
- Identification is done using the customer medium and the personal data stored in the application.
- Payment is made using Maestro, credit card, direct debit, or a payment method specific to the system.

The entitlement is loaded directly into the application on the customer medium.

If the customer does not yet have a customer medium but does have a contact-less reader, then secure identification of the customer may in future be able to take place using an eID, thus enabling the customer medium to be ordered securely and conveniently.

#### Technical equipment

The product provider operates an Internet sales platform, which is connected to the key, carrier and application management systems. The customer requires an NFC Mobile Device

<span id="page-125-0"></span>containing the appropriate application, and he may require an eID and contact-less home reader to set up a customer account.

## **10.1.4.2 Ticket system**

The ticket system supports the primary selling and handling processes:

- 1 Registering and ordering
- 2 Creating the entitlement
- 3 Payment, and checking creditworthiness
- 4 Managing the entitlements sold
- 5 Forwarding the necessary data to the inspection system

Customer data and orders are stored in the ticket system. Provided the transport service and product support it, seating can also be allocated using seating plans which are also stored there. The ticket system also incorporates a procedural management system which performs actions such as address comparisons and payment processing including credit checks, recording customer media, and producing and dispatching entitlements.

![](_page_125_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 10â4 An example of a ticket system with possible process flows** 

<span id="page-126-0"></span>A ticket system has interfaces to the key management system and the system which administers the carrier media and applications. All of the information required (apart from the information transferred in the key management system) is gathered together by the ticket system and sent to the service provider via a defined interface.

There are other interfaces to the sales points and the places where the carrier media are produced. This also includes sales and distribution, and the management of loading applications and products onto existing media via the Internet.

It can be assumed that a ticket system will be housed in a secure environment. Personaliser SAMs must be connected to it in order to be able to produce entitlements and load them onto carrier media.

From the point of view of the service provider, more than one ticket system can be used.

### **10.1.4.3 Central inspection system**

The inspection system helps the service provider to check the customers' journey entitlements, and to gather and pass on information relevant to invoicing. This requires the following functions:

- 1 Support of Process P3 for checking in, checking out and if necessary activation.
- 2 Support for the particular carrier media, applications and products.
	- a Implementation of the technical procedures required to use the carrier media, applications and products.
	- b Implementation and management of SAMs.
- 3 Receiving, distributing and utilising the information provided by the ticket systems.
- 4 Receiving, distributing and utilising the keys and identifiers provided by the system manager and registrar.
- 5 Reporting invoicing-related data and usage history to the ticket systems.

The terminals in public transport systems are not usually connected permanently to a data network. This applies especially to inspection devices in vehicles. That means all of the information required for entry, evaluation and activation of entitlements, and where applicable fare calculation, has to be stored locally in these terminals.

### **10.1.4.4 Service desks**

In real-life operation, a certain amount of defective customer media, incorrect operations, attacks on security and fraud attempts is inevitable. The service desk is the point of contact if problems occur when checking in and checking out.

Valid entitlements do not expire when the inspection equipment or customer medium fails, or if the customer does something incorrect. At the service desk, which is run by the service provider or product provider, the customer can receive a replacement entitlement or a refund.

For this to happen it must be possible to perform Process P4, "Blocking entitlements and carrier media", and to issue a replacement medium, quickly and efficiently

The following tasks are undertaken at the service desk:

1 Check the function of the carrier medium and the status of the entitlement. If a fault occurs, then:

2 Check whether the medium is genuine and/or check the identity of the customer. If positive, then:

- <span id="page-127-0"></span>3 Block the medium and entitlement presented.
- 4 Update the information in the ticket system and the carrier and application management systems.
- 5 Transfer the information from the ticket system to the inspection system.

### **10.1.4.5 Management system for NFC Mobile Devices and applications**

For the processes of loading applications and entitlements, and for the processes in which the NFC Mobile Device is used for identification and for utilising transport services, it is important to know the status of the NFC Mobile Device and the applications on it.

For this reason, the life-cycle of any carrier medium used in the system must be documented reliably. To this end a database is used which is connected via interfaces to the ticket system and the key management system. It contains information such as the following for every carrier medium:

- ID of carrier medium
- Type, version
- Provider of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- Issuer of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blacklisted)
- Stored applications (see below)
- etc.

Similarly, the life-cycle of the applications stored on the carrier medium must also be documented. Several different applications can be stored.

- ID of application
- Type, version, validity
- Application provider (ID via registrar)
- Application issuer (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blacklisted/delete)
- Stored products including ID of product provider
- Active products / deletable products

### **10.1.4.6 Management system for local transponders**

The life-cycle of a local transponder which is to be used in the system area must be documented reliably, for which a database is used. Information such as the following is entered in this database for every local transponder:

- ID of local transponder
- Type, version, validity
- Issuer of local transponder (ID via registrar)
- Service provider
- Status (e.g. not initialised, initialised, blacklisted)
- Applications supported (see below)
- Location allocation

<span id="page-128-0"></span>â¢ etc.

Similarly, the life-cycle of the application stored on the NFC Mobile Device must also be documented. It is assumed that local transponders only support one application each.

- ID of application
- Type, version, validity
- Application provider (ID via registrar)
- Application issuer (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. non-personalised/personalised/active/blacklisted/delete)

### **Table 10â9 Safeguards for ticket, inspection and management systems**

## **10.1.4.9 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk relating to key management should be determined and documented for each implementation.

## **10.1.5 Key management**

The job of the key management system is to provide keys used by multiple entities for all of the carrier media, applications and products in the system, and to do so securely and reliably. Key management is the responsibility of the security manager. A number of use cases are described in Section 7.10. [GSHB] can be used as a general guideline for implementation.

Keys are generated individually for each purpose. As far as possible, a distinct key is allocated to each form of interaction (e.g. loading applications, writing entitlements, reading entitlements, writing usage data). The precise characteristics have to be ascertained for each application scenario as part of the creation of a specific security concept that harmonises with the role model.

<span id="page-132-0"></span>The keys are generated in a secure environment and stored in a secure database. The various forms of SAM are also produced in this secure environment. The documentation of the life-cycle of the SAMs that are produced and issued is another of the key management system's tasks.

The SAMs and keys are generated by the security manager or his agents as and when users need them. The following types of SAM are basically supported:

| Initialiser SAMs      | Initialiser SAMs are required to initialise carrier media and load<br>applications.                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personaliser SAMs     | Personaliser SAMs are required to load entitlements in the ap<br>propriate applications.                                            |
| Service provider SAMs | Service provider SAMs are required by the service provider to<br>read and activate, blacklist and de-blacklist entitlements, and in |

Where required there may also be special SAMs that help transmit the product ID of the suppliers of carrier media, applications and entitlements securely onto the carrier medium.

some cases to send the usage data to the carrier medium.

Key information is normally loaded onto a SAM when the user requires it. The aim of an initialiser is, for example, to enable all of the carrier media that occur in its area to be initialised with the necessary applications without changing the SAM.

This kind of user-specific SAM must be configured under an agreement between the user of the SAM and the system manager.

The SAM should support the secure loading of new keys via a network. Ideally, updating can be done by the security manager directly.

#### **10.1.5.1 Key management for public transport service providers / SAMs for service providers**

Specific key information is required to evaluate entitlements. The reliability and security of the key management system involved in this is of critical importance to the overall concept. If the keys held by the service provider do not correspond with those in the carrier media and entitlements used for entry, then the evaluation of entitlements will not work. If keys are lost or made public, then the entire security concept will be discredited.

In this proposal, special SAMs are issued to the service provider as the operator of the inspection system. These service provider SAMs contain the key information relevant to the services offered, and must be integrated into the terminals.

When service provider SAMs are used, key management is restricted to the handing-over, handling and management of the SAMs. Since the keys are protected against unauthorised reading when using SAMs, the risk â and therefore the extent of the protection required â is limited. The use of standardised SAMs also reduces the expense of adapting to new applications.

### **10.1.5.2 Threats relevant to the key management system**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the assumptions used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-113-2)

**Table 10â11 Safeguards for the key management system** 

## **10.1.5.4 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk relating to key management should be determined and documented for each implementation.

## **10.2 Local transponders**

The local transponder is fixed permanently in a particular place and stores information about its location, which an NFC Mobile Device in active mode can then retrieve. This information is used for checking in and checking-out, or for activation in NFC-based eTicketing.

<span id="page-135-0"></span>The electrical function of the local transponder is the same as that of a passive transponder as defined in ISO/IEC14443.

Special requirements are determined by the following facts:

- 1 The local transponder is attached in a publicly accessible, often unsupervised place, which means it is unusually susceptible to vandalism. Intentional attacks on the function and security of data are also likely.

## **10.2.1 Initialising local transponders**

The initialisation of carrier media is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Section [7.11](#page-50-2). Initialisation is usually done by a special service provider before the transponder is installed.

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the initialisation system.

## **10.2.2 Loading the location information**

This is loaded onto the transponder either at the same time as initialisation, or by the service provider shortly before installation.

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the personalisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the personalisation system.

## <span id="page-137-0"></span>**10.2.3 Determining the protection demand for the local transponder**

The local transponders are part of the eTicketing infrastructure. It is assumed that the transponders for all the products supported by the system are used in the same way, so the considerations on protection demand described in [Table 10â1](#page-115-0) apply.

If product-specific local transponders are used instead, then a specific protection demand analysis for the specific application scenario would be advisable.

## **10.3.2 Initialising the NFC Mobile Device**

The initialisation of carrier media is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.2](#page-39-2), [7.3](#page-40-2) and [7.10.2.](#page-48-2) There are different ways of facilitating this:

- 1 Initialisation by a special service provider.
- 2 Initialisation controlled from the ticket system, in vending machines or ticket printers.
- 3 Applications are loaded onto existing customer media under the management of the ticket system.

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the initialisation system.

## **10.3.3 Personalising the NFC Mobile Device**

Loading entitlements is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.4](#page-41-2) and [7.10.3.](#page-49-2)

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the personalisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the personalisation system.

## **10.3.4 Determining the protection demand for the NFC Mobile Device**

The choice of protection demand category is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-142-1)

## **10.3.5 Threats to the NFC Mobile Device**

The following tables list the threats to the NFC Mobile Device. The allocation of protection categories is highly dependent on the product being supported, and therefore on the application scenario concerned, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11](#page-142-1).

## **10.3.6 Definition of specific safeguards**

The allocation of safeguards is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-142-1)

## <span id="page-142-1"></span><span id="page-142-0"></span>**11 Suggestions on executing the product-specific application scenarios**

## **11.1 Application scenario "Interoperable season entitlement with automatic fare calculation"**

## **11.1.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "season entitlement with fare calculation" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 High commercial value
- 2 Personal data (e.g. data about individuals and personal movement data)
- 3 Interoperability between the entities must be assured technically:
	- a Sales data
	- b Usage data
	- c Calculation data
- 4 The NFC Mobile Device is carrier around all the time by the user.
- 5 It may be combined with other application scenarios and products. The product is combined with lower-value products in the same application area. When determining the protection demand it must be borne in mind that this scenario could be endangered by other product implementations.

#### Conditions particular to this case

For reasons of cost and for operative reasons, it is not feasible that an NFC Mobile Device carrier medium would be issued as a supplement to an entitlement. In this application scenario it is therefore assumed that entitlements of the "Season entitlement with fare calculation" product type will be loaded onto the NFC Mobile Device carrier medium which the customer already owns. This means that a suitable application will also have to be loaded into the NFC Mobile Device's secure memory, assuming it is not already there.

When using an existing NFC Mobile Device, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

In this example, the application is loaded on over-the-air.

The entitlement is loaded over-the-air at the sales point or at a vending machine.

Check-in and check-out can sometimes happen offline, and are described in the "Offline check-in" and "Offline check-out" use cases.

On the basis of the criteria described in Section [8.2.5](#page-61-1), the application scenario can be assigned to the following protection demand categories:

## **11.1.5 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.
