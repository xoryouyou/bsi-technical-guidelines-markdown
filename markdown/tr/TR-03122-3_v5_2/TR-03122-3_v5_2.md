# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**1. Introduction**

This document is part three of the Conformance Test Specification (TR-03122). It is the counterpart of TR-03121-3 describing the test cases for the defined Function Modules.

Not all Function Modules have test cases associated with them.

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**2. Test Cases Function Modules**

The following sections define test cases for Function Modules.

# <span id="page-4-1"></span>**2.1. Test Cases Acquisition Hardware**

For test cases for dark field and light field scanners based on the optical principle of frustrated total reflection, the reader is referred to [\[TR-03118\]](#page-184-1) (German only). These test cases will be incorporated here in a future version of this guideline. Test cases for direct contact imaging scanners are defined in the following.

|                                |      | The obtained image files are converted to raw image data (pixel grey values without<br>header) and are processed with the software WinGeo. The program calculates the 1-<br>bar and 6-bar distances of the pattern in the image (across-bar accuracy) as well as the<br>along-bar accuracy. Also the resolution is calculated from the 6-bar distances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |

A flexible target has to be pressed against scan<br>ner platen to make sure the target is in contact with the platen over the entire pattern<br>area. If the target pattern covers less than 25% of scanners capture area, proce<br>dure is applied to the right and the left half of the capture area, respectively. The bars of<br>the Ronchi patterns have to be aligned with the pixel rows and columns to an angle less<br>than 0.5°. If the images from the scanner are inverted they have to be inverted back to<br>show dark patterns on a bright background. |  |  |

|                                |      | The black target is placed on the scanner platen and an image is taken. After that the<br>procedure is repeated with the white target. The definition of "black image" and "white<br>image" for the subsequent analyses depends on the grey value that the target would<br>produce in the final fingerprint image. If high reflectance produces a high grey value in<br>the final fingerprint image then the image obtained with the high reflectance target is<br>considered the "white image". If low reflectance produces a high grey value (inverting<br>behaviour) then the image obtained with the low reflectance target is considered the<br>"white image". The other image is then considered the "black image". |

The acquisition of fingerprints can be performed with the help a single fingerprint sensor or multi finger print sensor. In the first case TC-BIP-FP-APP-001 has to be applied, in the second case TC-BIP-FP-APP-002. Furthermore, in the case of four finger sensors TC-BIP-FP-APP-003 has to applied additionally.

- **•** Each artifact SHALL be tested ten times.
- **•** An artifact is considered as detected, if the device recognize six out of ten attempts. Further indepth tests are not required.
- **•** A device failed the total test, if a single artifact class was never recognized and/or nine artifacts in total were not detected (more than 25% failure rate).

# **2.10.7. Test Cases FM COD-FP-GSAT3**

#### **Test Case ID: TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-001**

Scope

Examine proper encoding of plain captured fingerprints for identification

Precondition

- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is running, required modules are loaded
- **•** A multi fingerprint scanner is connected
- **•** As necessary test resources: a test person to perform the fingerprint acquisition with
- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is configured to capture plain fingerprints for conformance testing purposes
	- **•** Perform manual acquisition of ten fingerprints using [IUT](#page-183-1)
	- **•** Provision of any other than biometric data (e.g. biographic, agency or process related) may be done in form of static dummy values by [IUT](#page-183-1), so that the process can be finalized and the resulting data is returned by [IUT](#page-183-1) as [GSAT](#page-183-6) XML
- **•** Test case initiation via test interface (TR-03122-1, Chapter 4, "Conformance Test Interfaces")
	- **•** Test case path: /TR03122/TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-001/1
	- **•** HTTP method: GET

Description

Perform the acquisition process using the [IUT](#page-183-1) with subsequent examination of returned result data

Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-183-1) via the test interface

**Table 2.266** Test Case ID: TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-001

#### **Test Case ID: TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-002**

#### Scope

Examine proper encoding of plain captured fingerprints for identification, with at least one missing finger during capture

Precondition

- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is running, required modules are loaded
- **•** A multi fingerprint scanner is connected
- **•** As necessary test resources: a test person to perform the fingerprint acquisition with
- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is configured to capture plain fingerprints for conformance testing purposes
	- **•** Perform manual acquisition of fingerprints, omit acquisition of at least one finger (i.e. by marking it as missing)
	- **•** Provision of any other than biometric data (e.g. biographic, agency or process related) may be done in form of static dummy values by [IUT](#page-183-1), so that the process can be finalized and the resulting data is returned by [IUT](#page-183-1) as [GSAT](#page-183-6) XML
- **•** Test case initiation via test interface (TR-03122-1, Chapter 4, "Conformance Test Interfaces")
	- **•** Test case path: /TR03122/TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-002/1
	- **•** HTTP method: GET

Description

Perform the acquisition process using the [IUT](#page-183-1) with subsequent examination of returned result data

Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-183-1) via the test interface

#### **Test Case ID: TC-COD-FP-GSAT3-004**

#### Scope

Examine proper encoding of rolled captured fingerprints for enrolment, with at least one missing finger during capture Precondition

- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is running, required modules are loaded
- **•** A multi fingerprint scanner is connected
- **•** As necessary test resources: a test person to perform the fingerprint acquisition with
- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is configured to capture rolled fingerprints for conformance testing purposes
	- **•** Perform manual acquisition of fingerprints, omit acquisition of at least one finger (i.e. by marking it as missing)
	- **•** Provision of any other than biometric data (e.g. biographic, agency or process related) may be done in form of static dummy values by [IUT](#page-183-1), so that the process can be finalized and the resulting data is returned by [IUT](#page-183-1) as [GSAT](#page-183-6) XML
- **•** Test case initiation via test interface (TR-03122-1, Chapter 4, "Conformance Test Interfaces")

#### Description

Perform the acquisition process using the [IUT](#page-183-1) with subsequent examination of returned result data

Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-183-1) via the test interface

| Expected Result                   | The resulting data is encoded and returned via the test interface in an appropriate<br>•<br>XML format, i.e. as GSAT XML embedded within a TR-03121 XML (element bio:XML<br>Record[@type="GSAT-xml"])                                                              |

# <span id="page-160-0"></span>**3.3. Test Cases PAP ACQ-FI-SV-2: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition with CIR Lookup**

#### **Test Case ID: TC-PAP-ACQ-FI-SV-2\_001**

#### Scope

Verify correct behaviour of the image acquisition process when a single admissible image is available from [Central Identity](#page-183-19) [Register \(CIR\)](#page-183-19)

#### Precondition

- **•** [IUT](#page-183-1) is running, required modules are loaded
- **•** As necessary test resource:

A locally available facial image of a test person (simulating [CIR](#page-183-19) data)

- **•** Image provision as BMP or JPEG using the test interface (TR-03122-1, Chapter 4, "Conformance Test Interfaces")
	- **•** Test case path: /TR03122/TC-P-PH-ARE-001/1
	- **•** HTTP method: POST

#### Description

#### Step 1

Check display of loaded image in [IUT](#page-183-1)

Initiate test case by loading the reference facial image using the test interface

- **•** Initiate test case by calling the [IUT](#page-183-1) via the test interface
- **•** Enforce insufficient quality of one fingerprint during capture of slap
