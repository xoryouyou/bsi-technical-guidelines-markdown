# 1 Introduction

The tense situation with respect to cybersecurity vulnerabilities has multiple reasons. The main reasons include firstly the low maturity regarding cybersecurity of products with digital elements as well as secondly insufficient and incoherent provision of security updates to address them. Additionally the users' lack of access to information that enable them to select and securely use products with an adequate level of cybersecurity. Users can find it difficult to assess whether the software they use has known exploitable vulnerabilities. For example, many cybersecurity managers had no information about whether their deployed products were affected by the Log4shell vulnerability, or they sometimes had to wait a long time to receive the desired information from the manufacturers. Increasing resilience to cyberattacks and technical disruptions is therefore a key task to mitigate the negative consequences of the cybersecurity threat situation for administrations, businesses and society. Therefore, all products should meet at least basic cybersecurity requirements. This includes not only the cybersecurity level and updates as mentioned above, but also the education of users as to which products have an appropriate level of cybersecurity.

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)1 will create a horizontal legal cybersecurity framework for the entire European Union (EU) internal market. It will establish cybersecurity requirements for the placing of products with digital elements on the Union market. This includes minimum requirements for the level of cybersecurity that all products with digital elements will have to comply with.

This Technical Guideline (TR) is intended to help manufacturers of products with digital elements in preparing for the upcoming CRA in form of requirements, recommendations, test actions and assessment criteria based on the (security) objectives stated in or derived from CRA Annex I (Essential Requirements) and Annex II (Information and Instructions to the User).

Feedback to this Technical Guideline can serve as input for the current and future work in the context of the draft standardisation request in support of Union policy on cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. This request asks amongst others for the development of standardisation deliverables that aim to become harmonised standards. Conformity with those harmonised standards would provide presumption of conformity within their scope.

This Technical Guideline will be:

- further adapted as a living document and requirements may be further concretised in the course of European standardisation efforts for the CRA and
- be superseded in the current form as soon as its content is covered by the corresponding standardisation deliverables under the standardisation request mentioned above.

# 1.1 Important Note

Conformity in the context of this Technical Guideline only applies to the requirements in this Technical Guideline and not necessarily to the requirements stated in the CRA. This Technical Guideline gives an initial interpretation of the upcoming European regulation.

**WARNING:** The application of this Technical Guideline:

- DOES NOT replace any legal obligation that might stem from the upcoming CRA and
- DOES NOT guarantee to fulfil any of these obligations.

# 2 Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 142 (RFC 21193, RFC 81744) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

<sup>2</sup> https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14

<sup>3</sup> https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119

<sup>4</sup> https://www. rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174

# 3 Basics

# 3.1 Security objectives and scope

The requirements stated in this Technical Guideline apply to all products with digital elements placed on the market which includes their remote data processing solutions. They focus primarily on the product directly and the communication and interaction with their corresponding remote data processing solutions. Organisational requirements for the operation of remote data processing solutions are not part of this document and SHOULD follow best practices for Information Security Management System (ISMS), e.g. ISO 27001 based on "IT-Grundschutz"5.

The requirements stated in this Technical Guideline are intended to mitigate baseline threats that are typically considered e.g. in use cases for private households or professional use cases for uncritical business processes. Generally, the security properties of a product with digital elements have to be appropriate to the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use of the product determined by the manufacturer and have to be designed, produced and maintained accordingly.

The requirements of this Technical Guideline can be used for an assessment on a technology and product agnostic level. Following this scope, guidance for the assessment is given without technical details on a possible implementation as especially the implementation of the essential requirements in section 5.3 may differ widely depending on the type of product, as well as the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use of the product. To address this situation this Technical Guideline gives guidance indicating when a requirement applies.

This document can be used for assessment in the current state. Nevertheless additional technical information and examples are planned to be provided in the future to facilitate an implementation of the requirements depending on the use case.

The requirements for the vulnerability handling process in section 5.4 and documentation obligations in section 6 are generally valid for all types of products and are independent of the intended purpose and foreseeable use of the products.

# 3.2 Roles

The requirements described in this Technical Guideline are based on the interaction between the following entities.

# **3.2.1 Consumer/User**

Consumers in the scope of this Technical Guideline are end consumers buying products for personal or professional use. Consumer are generally not redistributing/reselling these products in a commercial manner. The terms consumer and user are used interchangeable.

As part of the supply chain, if a consumer reuses a product with digital elements as a component for a new product with digital elements and places it on the market, the consumer takes the role of a manufacturer.

# **3.2.2 Manufacturer**

The CRA defines "manufacturer" as a natural or legal person who develops or manufactures products with digital elements or has products with digital elements designed, developed or manufactured, and markets them under its name or trademark, whether for monetisation or free of charge.

 <sup>5</sup> https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it-grundschutz\_node.html

As the CRA is a market access regulation, "manufacturer" is interpreted as combining the roles of "vendor" and "creator".

"Vendor" (German: "Anbieter") describes the role of the entity that providesthe product with digital elements. Alternatively, but not necessarily with a commercial background, the terms "Supplier" (German: "Lieferant") is used.

"Creator" (German: "Ersteller") describes the role of the entity that authored or created the product with digital elements.

As this Technical Guideline specifies technical requirements, it uses a different terminology and interprets "manufacturer" as a combination of the entity that produces tangible goods, such as devices, and the entity that creates or provides intangible goods, such as software and software components, usually described by the term "author". Therefore, this Technical Guideline does not mention the terms "Economic Operator", "Distributor" or "Importer" as defined by the CRA, as the roles of these parties are unrelated to the technical requirements stated here. These technical requirements are independent of the role which is fulfilling them.

# **3.2.3 Evaluator**

The entity applying the assessment criteria to the requirements of this Technical Guideline. The evaluator may be the manufacturer itself or a third-party testing body.

# 3.3 Conformity Assessment

The conformity assessment for the requirements set out in this Technical Guideline are primarily focused on a self-assessment by the manufacturer or by a third-party conformity assessment body on behalf of the manufacturer.

This Technical Guideline does not include specific implementation proposals for the requirements stated in sections 5.3 and 5.4. Those are planned to be provided in an additional guidance document.

# **3.3.1 Target of Evaluation (TOE)**

The conformity assessmentis performed on a single instance of the product(with digital elements), the Target of Evaluation (TOE). The TOE includes all parts of the product and their remote data processing solutions, which are part of the product at the time of assessment.

# **3.3.2 Time of assessment**

All requirements set out in this Technical Guideline have to be met by the TOE for its whole intended lifetime.

As it cannot be avoided that the TOE is modified to an insecure state by the user, only the state after the initial configuration following the recommendations in the user's manual and (potentially) update to the newest version are relevant for the assessment. This state can be achieved by executing the following steps:

- Obtaining a new product or resetting the product to its original state, e.g. factory reset or new installation.
- Start up of the product and initial setup following the recommendations in the user's manual.
- Preforming an update to the newest software version, if not performed during the initial setup.

# **3.3.3 Requirement structure**

Each requirement consists of the following parts:

- **Requirement/Recommendation:** Requirement/recommendation of this Technical Guideline which has to be met by the TOE. Those statements can be recommended or mandatory, as indicated by the corresponding modal verbs.
- **Condition** (Optional)**:** Requirements/Recommendations with a condition apply to the product if the condition is met. The condition is intended to give the manufacturer an indication on which requirements apply to the product.
- **Assessment criteria:** Units and criteria that need to be applied by the Evaluator to perform the conformity assessment for this Technical Guideline.

# **3.3.4 Assessment procedure**

This section specifies an assessment procedure on how to assess that the security requirements and recommendations stated in this Technical Guideline are met. For reproducibility and consistency every decision made during the assessment as well as the used method and result has to be documented by the evaluator according to section 6.1. The evaluator applies the following order for each requirement and recommendation:

- 1. Check the condition, to see if the requirement or recommendation is applicable. If that is the case or no condition is given, move on to the next assessment step. If the requirement or recommendation does not apply, mark the requirement as "N/A", document the decision and move on to the next requirement.
- 2. Perform each step of the assessment criteria, evaluate the result and mark the requirement or recommendation as "PASS", "FAIL" or "INCONCLUSIVE". A requirement or recommendation is marked as "PASS" if all assessment steps are performed successfully, otherwise FAIL. The execution of an assessment step often includes an evaluation indicated by "assess that/if/whether". Only if the evaluation by the evaluator of the assessed property is positive, the assessment step can be completed successfully. If the evaluation step cannot be completed because the evaluatoris not able to prove the assessed property beyond doubt, the test step fails and the requirement or recommendation is marked as "INCONCLUSIVE".

The requirements and recommendations do not include details on the evidences or procedures of the assessment to attain flexibility for first- and third-party assessments. Generally, it is assumed that the assessment is at least performed on a conceptual level, e.g. by checking public or internal product documentation. Conceptual assessments may also include the inspection of configuration files or source code, if no separate documentation is available.

If feasible, this procedure has to be enhanced by a functional assessment, i.e. an assessment of the TOE's real behaviour or an audit or retrospective inspection of an implemented process. If no functional assessment can be performed, the evaluator has to document a sufficient justification for not performing a functional assessment.

The assessment is preferably integrated into the development processes and continuous quality assurance processes, if possible in an automated matter.

The assessment step might include one of the following terms, which have to be interpreted by the evaluator:

- **Check:** Generate a result by a simple comparison
- **Assess:** Generate a result by analysis using evaluator expertise
- **Best practice:** The requirement has to be implemented according to what is considered state of the art for a specific use case. This expression is mostly used in conjunction with cryptography. For best practice cryptography common and well-known cryptography recommendations MUST be used, e.g. BSI TR-02102, SOG-IS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms or comparable standards.
- **Without undue delay:** The action required has to be performed as soon as possible. The evaluator MUST assess whether the requested action was performed in a time not substantially longer than necessary for the specific scenario. For comparison, other similar real-life scenarios MAY be used.

When in doubt the evaluator MAY request additional information from the manufacturer, to justify any delays and ascertain that the manufacturer acted as soon as possible.

• **Document and publish**: If a requirement states that something must be documented, this means that the manufacturer possesses a record which is not necessarily available for public access. Publish means that something is documented and available for public access.

The overall verdict "PASS" is given if all applicable mandatory (MUST) requirements are marked as "PASS" and all applicable recommendations (SHOULD) are either marked as:

- "PASS" or
- marked as "FAIL" or "INCONCLUSIVE" with a sufficient justification why the recommendation is not met.

Otherwise the overall verdict is "FAIL".

# 4 Risk assessment

To evaluate the cybersecurity risk related to the TOE the manufacturer has to perform a risk assessment. To be able to get a full overview of the risks related to the TOE, the risk assessment has to consider the complete life cycle of the TOE. This includes the planning, design, development and production phase, as well as the deliver, maintenance phase/support period and decommission by the user. The risk assessment also has to consider the product's intended purpose, as well as the reasonably foreseeable use by the customer. Based on the intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable use, the manufacturer has to derive potential threats and threat agents as well as their probability of occurrence and impact on the security of the TOE, including the risk for health and safety of the consumer.

# 4.1 Important Note

The focus of the risk assessment of this Technical Guideline is to identify implementation details of the essential requirements and necessary additional security capabilities for the specific product.

**WARNING:** The risk assessment of this Technical Guideline MUST NOT be used to omit any of the requirements of section 5.3, see also section 5.1.

# 4.2 REQ\_RA 1 – Risk assessment

**Requirement stated in the current draft of the CRA Annex I Part 1:** Products with digital elements shall be designed, developed and produced in such a way that they ensure an appropriate level of cybersecurity based on the risks.

# **4.2.1 REQ\_RA 1.1**

### **Requirement**

- The manufacturer MUST perform and document the risk assessment for the TOE.
- As part of the risk assessment the manufacturer MUST document how the support period is determined and how that impacts the lifecycle of the TOE.

- The evaluator MUST assess that the risk assessment for the TOE is performed and documented.
- The evaluator MUST assess that the risk assessment for the TOE contains threats and threat agents.
- The evaluator MUST assess that the risk assessment for the TOE contains security impact and probability of relevant threats.
- The evaluator MUST assess that the risk assessment for the TOE documents how the support period is determined and how that impacts the lifecycle of the TOE.

# 5 Security requirements

To minimise the cybersecurity risks throughout the TOE's lifecycle (planning, design, development, manufacturing, delivery, maintenance and decommission by the user), including when using third-party components, as well as during the support period, the manufacturer has to ensure the conformity of their product, at least with the essential requirements set out in section 5.3. These are intended to ensure an appropriate baseline level of cybersecurity according to best practices.

This Technical Guideline raises no claim of completeness and no claim of providing a tailor-made solution as this is highly dependent on the specific product and the associated risk determined by the manufacturer.

# 5.1 Important Note

Concerning the conformity to this Technical Guideline it is not possible to omit any of the requirements of section 5.3 based on the risk assessment done in section 4.2.

**WARNING:** This approach is less flexible then the risk based approach in the CRA.

# 5.2 Application Guidance

To provide some guidance on when each requirement has to be applied, even independent of a specific risk assessment, the following indicators will be used.

It must be considered what kind of data assets are stored or processed by the TOE, e.g. system data, personal data or critical security data.

# **System data:**

General non-critical and non-sensitive (security) data with no relation to a specific person and no relevant impact to the security of the TOE and the safety and security of the user in case the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered.

### **Sensitive system data:**

Data with no relation to a specific person and no relevant impact to the security of the TOE, but with a significant potential for damage, financial or otherwise, or impact to the safety or security of the user in case the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered. This includes e.g. confidential business information or surveillance camera recordings.

### **Personal data:**

General data concerning a specific person with no significant potential damage to the user in case the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered. This includes e.g. names and public photos.

### **Sensitive personal data:**

Data concerning a specific person with a significant potential damage to the user in case the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered. This includes health data, private messages and personal financial information.

### **Security data:**

Security-relevant data with no relation to a specific person, but with significant impact on the security of the TOE in case the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered. This includes e.g. passwords, security critical configuration.

### **Critical security data:**

Security-relevant data with no relation to a specific person, but with significant impact on the security of the TOE and other products in case the integrity and confidentiality of the data is endangered. This includes e.g. master keys.

Another criterion is the potential attack surface and opportunity. This correlates on how the TOE communicates with other products with digital elements and how it can be physically accessed. A TOE which only communicates via local interfaces may pose a lower risk regarding security, than a TOE which is permanently connected to a public network.

#### **Public network:**

The TOE communicates via a Wide Area Network (WAN).

### **Local network:**

The TOE communicates via a local network (WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.) but has no capabilities to access the WAN.

### **Local (Public):**

The TOE uses local interfaces without network access (e.g. USB, NFC and local Application Programming Interfaces (API)). The TOE is foreseeably used in a public space and can be locally interacted with by anyone in a substantial time frame, e.g. an automated kiosk.

#### **Local (Restricted Public):**

The TOE uses local interfaces without network access (e.g. USB, NFC and local Application Programming Interfaces (API)). The TOE is foreseeably used in a public space and can be locally interacted with by anyone without supervision for a short period of time, e.g. temporarily unsupervised private notebook.

#### **Local (Restricted):**

The TOE uses local interfaces without network access (USB, NFC and local Application Programming Interfaces (API)). The TOE is foreseeably used in a physically restricted environment, which can only be accessed by selected individuals, e.g. Smart TV for Home Entertainment or Office Printer.

Security requirements stated in this Technical Guideline may depend on the data assets or communicative capabilities of the TOE. This is indicated by a corresponding condition.

If a TOE does not meet a requirement based on the communicative capabilities, it is possible to transfer the risk associated with the communication by delegating the requirements to a separate proxy product. This is only possible if the TOE ensures that the relevant communication is only possible via the proxy product, e.g. by establishing a trust relationship with the proxy for remote network communication.

The condition represents guidance to facilitate the decision if a requirement applies.
