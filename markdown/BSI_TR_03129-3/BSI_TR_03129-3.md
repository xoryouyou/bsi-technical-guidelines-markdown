# <span id="page-4-0"></span>1. Introduction

This technical guideline specifies PKI-related communication protocols for security mechanisms in the context of electronic identity documents based on Extended Access Control (EAC). This document is part of the BSI TR-03129 series and depends on the [TR-03129-1] base document that describes the basic communication protocols, security mechanisms, web service messages, etc.

For PKI-related communication protocols for security mechanisms for machine readable travel documents with regard to document checks for public and official authorities refer to BSI [TR-03129-2].

Requirements for the CVCA-eID public key infrastructure (CVCA-eID PKI) and its participants are given in the certificate policy in [CP-eID].

## 1.1 Security Mechanisms

Data stored on electronic identity (eID) documents has to be protected against manipulation and unauthorized access by Passive Authentication (PA) and Terminal Authentication (TA), as part of Extended Access Control (EAC), respectively. Restricted Identification (RI) is a mechanism, that allows the usage of an eID document over networks in a privacy protecting way by providing "sector-specific" identifiers. These can be used to identify the eID document within each sector, instead of relying on globally unique identifiers like serial numbers or chip-individual public keys.

## 1.1.1 Supporting Lists

The security mechanisms are supported by three types of lists used for different purposes:

- **Master Lists:** To support the secure distribution of CSCA certificates, Master Lists according to [ICAO 9303] have been introduced. Master Lists are signed lists of (nationally) trusted CSCA certificates. Thus, the terminals only have to store the public key required for the verification of such a Master List securely.
- **Defect Lists:** A defect is defined as a production error affecting a large number of documents. The withdrawal of already issued documents is impractical or even impossible if the detected defect is contained in foreign documents. Defect Lists are signed lists to handle such defects. Defects are identified by the Document Signer Certificate(s) used to produce defect documents. Defect Lists are thus errata that not only inform about defects but also provides corrigenda to fix the error where possible.
- **Block Lists:** Block Lists are signed lists containing the sector-specific identifiers of revoked documents. As those identifiers are sector specific, a separate Block List is produced for every sector.

## 1.1.2 Passive Authentication

Passive Authentication is a mechanism standardized in [ICAO 9303], Part 11, Section 5.1 and [TR-03110-1], Sec. 1.1. Passive Authentication uses a digital signature to authenticate data stored on the eID documents. This signature is generated by a Document Signer (DS) in the personalization phase of the eID documents . The Document Signer in turn is certified by the Country Signing CA (CSCA) of the issuing country.

If a terminal has to read data from a eID document, the terminal must perform Passive Authentication to verify that the data is authentic and has not been manipulated. For Passive Authentication the terminal must have access to the corresponding Document Signer certificate and Country Signing CA certificate. While the Document Signer certificate can usually easily be obtained from the eID document itself, the CSCA certificate must be securely distributed to and stored on the terminal.

## 1.1.3 Terminal Authentication

Terminal Authentication is a mechanism standardized in [TR-03110-1] (TAv1) and [TR-03110-2] (TAv2). Terminal Authentication is based on a challenge-response protocol using digital signatures and cardverifiable (CV) certificates both to be validated by the eID document. After verification of the terminal certificate the eID document calculates the rights assigned to the terminal and grants the terminal access to the corresponding data stored on the eID document. The terminal certificate is issued by the Document Verifier (DV) the terminal is associated with. The Document Verifier in turn is certified by (at least) the national Country Verifying CA (CVCA) but it may also be certified by foreign CVCAs.

If a terminal has to read data protected by EAC from an eID document, the terminal must perform Terminal Authentication to prove that the terminal is authorized to access this data. For Terminal Authentication the terminal must present the eID document a certificate chain that starts at a certificate verifiable by the eID document using a trusted public key of the CVCA of the issuing country stored on the chip and ends at the terminal certificate for which the terminal possesses the corresponding private key.

## 1.1.4 Restricted Identification

Restricted Identification is a mechanism standardized in [TR-03110-2], Section 3.6. The mechanism provides sector-specific identifiers for the chip. The identifier calculated by Restricted Identification has the following properties:

- Within each sector the sector-specific identifier of every eID document's chip is unique.
- Across any two sectors, it is computationally impossible to link the two sector-specific identifier of any eID documents chip.

Restricted Identification can be used only after Terminal Authentication (and Chip Authentication) has been performed successfully between the terminal and the chip of a eID document. The calculation of the sectorspecific identifier is based on a special public key of the sector, which is given by the terminal to the chip of the eID document. The chip proves the authenticity of this public key using the CV certificate of the terminal used within terminal authentication. By the key and certificate management it is assured that only the authorised owner of the key pair can use an eID document to calculate the sector-specific identifier of the chip of that eID document.

## 1.2 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]. The key word "CONDITIONAL" is to be interpreted as follows:

**CONDITIONAL:** The usage of an item is dependent on the usage of other items. It is therefore further qualified under which conditions the item is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED.

When used in tables (profiles), the key words are abbreviated as shown in Table [1.](#page-5-0)

| Key word             | Equivalent  | Abbrev. |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| MUST / SHALL         | REQUIRED    | m       |
| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT | –           | x       |
| SHOULD               | RECOMMENDED | r       |
| MAY                  | OPTIONAL    | o       |
| –                    | CONDITIONAL | c       |

## 4.2 Distribution of CV Certificates, TLS-Certificates and Request-Signer Certificates

The following messages RequestCertificate, GetCACertificates, GetCertificate and SendCertificates are used for the management of CV certificates described in [TR-03110-3] at a national level in addition to the default messages defined [TR-03129-1]:

## 4.2.1 RequestCertificate

This message is used by a terminal to request the generation of a new certificate for one of its keys from the DV. If the parent DV processes this message asynchronously, it MUST respond using the SendCertificates message.

The message RequestCertificate is defined as described in [TR-03129-1], except for the following **additional or refined** parameters.

#### **Input parameters:**

• certReq **(REQUIRED)**

This parameter contains the certificate request. It MUST be constructed according to Appendix C.2 of [TR-03110-3]. The encoding MUST follow the specifications in Appendix D of [TR-03110-3].

#### **Output parameters:**

- certificateSeq **(CONDITIONAL)**
- returnCode **(REQUIRED)**

All return codes defined for RequestCertificate in [TR-03129-1] and the following **additional** return codes are possible:

- failure\_certificate\_holder\_inactive
- failure\_certificate\_holder\_reference\_in\_use
- failure\_certificate\_holder\_unknown
- failure\_certification\_authority\_holder\_unknown

- failure\_outer\_signature
- failure\_request\_not\_accepted
- ok\_reception\_ack **(DEPRECATED)**

## 4.2.2 GetCACertificates (Deprecated)

Renamed to GetCertificates. See below.

### 4.2.3 GetCertificates

This message is sent by a DV or by a terminal to a CVCA or to a DV, respectively, in order to get all relevant CA certificates of the national CVCA or foreign CVCAs. In this sense, a CA certificate is regarded as relevant if it is still valid and if it is needed for the verification of a (valid) certificate of the DV (generated by the CVCA).

The message requests the DV or CVCA to return a chain of certificates including all valid link certificates, beginning with the first Root-CA certificate.

If the parent DV or CVCA processes this message asynchronously, it SHALL respond using the SendCertificates message.

The message GetCertificates is defined as described in [TR-03129-1].

*Deprecation Note 1: This message* GetCertificates *replaces the deprecated message*  GetCACertificates *which MAY be implemented for a transitional period to provide backward compatibility. They will be removed in a future version of this document.*

## 4.2.4 SendCertificates

If a CVCA or DV processes one of the messages RequestCertificate or GetCertificates asynchronously, it uses a response message SendCertificates to communicate the result of its processing. It sends the response message always to that URL which is determined from the TLS-certificate of the sender of the request-message.

This message can also be used to notify registered entities about the availability of new certificates. In this case the messageID MUST be omitted.

This message itself MUST always be processed synchronously by its receiver.

The message SendCertificates is defined as described in [TR-03129-1], except for the following **additional or refined** parameters.

#### **Input parameters:**

• statusInfo **(REQUIRED)**

All status codes defined for SendCertificates in [TR-03129-1] and the following **additional** status codes are possible:

- failure\_domain\_parameters
- failure\_expired
- failure\_inner\_signature
- failure\_outer\_signature
- failure\_request\_not\_accepted

## 4.2.5 GetCertificateDescription

This message is only used by an eID-Server that participates in the Online-Authentication based on Extended Access Control Version 2 (EAC2) between an eService and an eID document. Hereby, the eID-Server assumes the role of the remote terminal.

This message is sent by an eID-Server to its DV (which is called BerCA in that case) in order to get the CertificateDescription of a specific terminal CV certificate.

To enable the BerCA to return the corresponding CertificateDescription, the hash value CertificateDescriptionHash given in the respective terminal CV certificate must be provided by the eID-Server.

#### **Input parameters:**

This parameter MUST include the hash value of the CertificateDescription object as included in the CertificateDescriptionHash extension of the remote terminal CV certificate.

#### **Output parameters:**

• certificateDescription **(CONDITIONAL)**

This parameter contains the DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of the certificateDescription object (as described in [TR-03110-4]) for which the hash value is included into the CertificateDescriptionHash extension of the remote terminal certificate.

• returnCode **(REQUIRED)**

#### • hash **(REQUIRED)**

The following return codes are possible:

- failure\_incorrect\_request
- failure\_internal\_error
- failure\_other\_error
- failure\_syntax
- ok\_received\_correctly
- returnCodeMessage **(OPTIONAL)**

#### 4.2.6 SendeIDServerCerts

This message is only used by an eID-Server that participates in the Online-Authentication based on Extended Access Control Version 2 (EAC2) between an eService and an eID document. Hereby, the eID-Server assumes the role of the remote terminal.

This message is sent by an eID-Server to its DV (which is called BerCA in that case) in order to submit the X.509 (TLS) certificates for calculating the hash value of the TLS certificates placed in the set commCertificates according to [TR-03110-4], 2.2.6.

The certificates shall be shipped within a CMS container of ContentType SignedData. To sign the CMS container, a valid RSC shall be used. The specification of the CMS container and the applicationspecific OID, defining the encapsulated content, is given in [TR-03129-Annex].

#### **Input parameters:**

• cmsContainer **(REQUIRED)**

#### **Output parameters:**

• returnCode **(REQUIRED)**

The following return codes are possible:

- failure\_eContentType
- failure\_entanglement\_error
- failure\_expired
- failure\_inner\_signature
- failure\_internal\_error
- failure\_other\_error
- failure\_outer\_signature

## 4.2.7 RequestPKICommunicationCert

This message is only used by an eID-Server that participates in the Online-Authentication based on Extended Access Control Version 2 (EAC2) between an eService and an eID document. Hereby, the eID-Server assumes the role of the remote terminal.

This message is sent by an eID-Server to its DV (which is called BerCA in that case) in order to submit the PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request for renewing the TLS client certificate regarding PKI communication. This message shall be processed synchronously and works in conjunction with the message GetPKICommunicationCert.

The request shall be shipped within a CMS container of ContentType SignedData. To sign the CMS container, a valid RSC shall be used. The specification of the CMS container and the application-specific OID, defining the encapsulated content, is given in [TR-03129-Annex].

After the BerCA has successfully validated the CMS container and the request itself, the BerCA issues a new TLS client certificate regarding PKI communication. The transfer of the TLS client certificate back to the eID-Server is based on a polling mechanism. For the eID-Server to receive the TLS client certificate issued by the BerCA, the message GetPKICommunicationCert must be called subsequently. The BerCa should send the earliest possible timestamp when the next certificate may be available using noPollBefore.

#### **Input parameters:**

| • | messageID                                | (REQUIRED) |
|---|------------------------------------------|------------|
| • | cmsContainer                             | (REQUIRED) |

## 4.2.8 GetPKICommunicationCert

This message is only used by an eID-Server that participates in the Online-Authentication based on Extended Access Control Version 2 (EAC2) between an eService and an eID document. Hereby, the eID-Server assumes the role of the remote terminal.

This message is sent by an eID-Server to its DV (which is called BerCA in that case) in order to poll for the TLS client certificate issued by the BerCA. This message shall be processed synchronously and works in conjunction with the message RequestPKICommunicationCert.

After the eID-Server has called the message RequestPKICommunicationCert, the message GetPKICommunicationCert must be called with the same messageID to retrieve the issued TLS client certificate. If the BerCA has not yet fully processed the PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request and therefore the new TLS client certificate has not yet been issued, the message GetPKICommunicationCert must be called again by the eID-Server. The BerCa should send the earliest possible timestamp when the next certificate may be available using noPollBefore. A successful polling request using the message GetPKICommunicationCert results in the return of the corresponding TLS client certificate.

#### **Input parameters:**

| •<br>messageID                           | (REQUIRED)    |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Output parameters:                       |               |

| •<br>returnCode                          | (REQUIRED)    |
| The following return codes are possible: |               |
| •<br>failure_cert_not_available          |               |

- failure\_internal\_error
- failure\_messageID\_unknown
- failure\_other\_error
- failure\_syntax
- ok\_cert\_available
- returnCodeMessage **(OPTIONAL)**

## 4.2.9 SendRSCCert

This message is only used by an eID-Server that participates in the Online-Authentication based on Extended Access Control Version 2 (EAC2) between an eService and an eID document. Hereby, the eID-Server assumes the role of the remote terminal.

This message is sent by an eID-Server to its DV (which is called BerCA in that case) in order to submit the new Request Signer Certificate intended to replace the previously submitted RSC.

The message SendRSCCert is defined as described in [TR-03129-1],

## 4.3 Implementation as Web Services

It is RECOMMENDED that the protocol given in this chapter is realised as a Web Service using the SOAP messages described in the attached WSDL specifications.

## 4.3.1 Services Implemented by the CVCA/SPOCs

A CVCA/SPOC has to implement a Web Service supporting the following (callback) messages:

- RequestCertificate
- GetCertificates

## 4.3.2 Services Implemented by DVs

For the communication with its associated inspection systems a DV has to implement a Web Service supporting the following messages:

- RequestCertificate
- GetCertificates

If a DV supports callback messages sent by the CVCA/SPOC, the Web Service of the DV MUST in addition also support the following (callback) messages:

• SendCertificates

The following message needs only to be implemented, if the DV acts as a BerCA and issues authorization certificates to service providers for the use of the online authentication functionality:

- GetCertificateDescription
- SendeIDServerCerts
- RequestPKICommunicationCert
- GetPKICommunicationCert
- SendRSCCert

### 4.3.3 Services Implemented by Terminals

A terminal has to implement the following Web Service only, if they support callback messages sent by their DV. In this case they have to implement the Web Services supporting the following (callback) messages:

• SendCertificates

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>5. Protocols for Restricted Identification

This section contains the description of the messages related to Restricted Identification.

## 5.1 Specific Parameters and Return Codes

The following input and output parameters are used frequently in this section.

## 5.1.1 Parameters

• deltaIndicator

This parameter indicates, if the caller wants to download the complete block list or only a delta list. In the first case the parameter is set to complete\_list, in the second case it is set to delta\_list.

• deltaBase

This parameter contains the list identifier (listID, cf. Appendix [B.1\)](#page-30-1) of the block list currently available to the caller if the deltaIndicator parameter is set to delta\_list. Then the delta request will provide the delta items (added, removed) in respect to this version.

• deltaListAddedItems

If a delta list is transferred (deltaIndicator = delta\_list) this parameter contains the list of items added to the block list since the version given in the deltaBase parameter. The list is empty if no item was added between the given deltaBase and the current block list. This parameter is REQUIRED if a delta list will be sent with the response. It MUST be missing if no delta list will be sent with the response.

• deltaListRemovedItems

If a delta list is transferred (deltaIndicator = delta\_list) this parameter contains the list of items removed since the version given in the deltaBase parameter. The list is empty if no item was removed between the given deltaBase and the current block list. This parameter is REQUIRED if a delta list will be sent with the response. It MUST be missing if no delta list will be sent with the response.

• completeListURL

This parameter contains the URL, where the caller can download the latest version of the complete block list. After downloading the complete list from the URL the caller SHOULD trigger a further delta list request. This is because the block list provider may provide the complete list only at a particular time e.g. only on a daily base. This parameter is REQUIRED if a complete list will be sent with the response. It MUST be missing if no complete list will be sent with the response.

If delta lists are generated, deltaListAddedItems and deltaListRemovedItems MUST NOT contain the same sector-specific identifiers.

## 5.1.2 Return Codes

• ok\_list\_available

The message has been processed successfully. Either the output parameters deltaListAddedItems and deltaListRemovedItems contain the delta information in respect to the base version, or the output parameter completeListURL contains the URL where the caller can download the new list.

• ok\_no\_update\_needed

The message has been processed successfully, but there is no update for the block list needed. The block list currently available by the caller (as indicated by the parameter deltaBase) is still up to date.

• ok\_complete\_list

The caller has requested a delta list, but its available block list version (as indicated in the deltaBase input parameter) is too old to be updated by a delta list or the size of the delta list would exceed certain technically implied constraints. A complete list (i.e. URL) is provided instead.

• failure\_deltaBase\_unknown

The identifier deltaBase is unknown by the receiver. In this case further procedures must be determined by organisational measures.

• failure\_sectorID\_unknown

The sector identifier is unknown by the DV/MBS. In this case further procedures must be determined by organisational measures.

## 5.2 Distribution of Sector Public Keys

The following messages are used for the management of public keys required for Restricted Identification.

#### 5.2.1 GetSectorPublicKey

This message is used by an authentication terminal to download its sector public key from the DV it is associated to. The message is also used by a DV to download the sector public key of the revocation sector from the Master Blocklisting Service (MBS).

#### **Input parameters:**

• sectorID **(REQUIRED)**

This parameter contains the identifier of the requested sector public key. The identifier is contained in the terminal certificate issued by the DV and in the block list provided by the Master Blocklisting Service (MBS).

#### **Output parameters:**

• sectorPK **(CONDITIONAL)**

This parameter will contain the sector public key as data object (cf. [TR-03110-3], Appendix B4.1), if the message has been processed successfully.

- returnCode **(REQUIRED)**
	- failure\_internal\_error
	- failure\_other\_error
	- failure\_sectorID\_unknown
	- failure\_syntax
	- ok\_PK\_available

The message has been processed successfully. The output parameter sectorPK contains the requested sector public key.

• returnCodeMessage **(OPTIONAL)**

# 5.3 Distribution of Block Lists

The following sections contain the description of the messages for the distribution of block lists (cf. Appendix [B](#page-30-0)).

## 5.3.1 GetBlockList

This message is used by a DV or an authentication terminal to download the most recent block list from the MBS or DV, respectively.

The caller can indicate if it wishes to download the complete block list or only a delta list. If the caller requests the download of the complete list, the block list provider MUST provide a complete list. Block list providers MAY support delta list requests. If the caller requests a delta list but the block list provider does not support delta lists it MUST return a complete block list. An eID-Server supporting multiple sectors will receive BlockListDetails for all sectors, unless a specific sector is selected using the sectorID field

### **Input parameters:**

| • | callbackIndicator | (REQUIRED)               |
|---|-------------------|--------------------------|
| • | messageID         | (CONDITIONAL)            |
| • | responseURL       | (DEPRECATED), (OPTIONAL) |
| • | deltaIndicator    | (REQUIRED)               |
| • | deltaBase         | (CONDITIONAL)            |
| • | sectorID          | (OPTIONAL)               |
|   |                   |                          |

This message is only used by an eID-Server that supports multiple eServices. The parameter sectorID indicates the eService's sector identifier for which the block list is requested.

#### **Output parameters:**

| • | deltaListAddedItems   | (CONDITIONAL) |
|---|-----------------------|---------------|
| • | deltaListRemovedItems | (CONDITIONAL) |
| • | completeListURL       | (CONDITIONAL) |

- failure\_internal\_error
- failure\_other\_error
- failure\_synchronous\_processing\_not\_possible
- failure\_syntax
- ok\_complete\_list
- ok\_list\_available
- ok\_no\_update\_needed
- ok\_reception\_ack **(DEPRECATED)**

- ok\_syntax
- returnCodeMessage **(OPTIONAL)**

### 5.3.2 SendBlockList

If the MBS or a DV processes the message GetBlockList asynchronously, it uses a response message SendBlockList to communicate the result of its processing. It sends the response message always to that URL which is determined from the TLS-certificate of the sender of the request-message.

This message can also be used to notify registered entities about the availability of a new block list. In this case the messageID MUST be omitted.

This message itself MUST always be processed synchronously by its receiver.

#### **Input parameters:**

• messageID **(CONDITIONAL)** • statusInfo **(REQUIRED)** The following status codes are possible: • failure\_deltaBase\_unknown • failure\_sectorID\_unknown • failure\_internal\_error • failure\_other\_error • failure\_syntax • ok\_complete\_list • ok\_list\_available • ok\_no\_update\_needed • statusInfoMessage **(OPTIONAL)** • deltaListAddedItems **(CONDITIONAL)** • deltaListRemovedItems **(CONDITIONAL)** • completeListURL **(CONDITIONAL) Output parameters:** • returnCode **(REQUIRED)** The following return codes are possible: • failure\_internal\_error • failure\_messageID\_unknown • failure\_other\_error • failure\_syntax • ok\_received\_correctly

## 5.4 Implementation as Web Services

It is RECOMMENDED that the protocol given in this chapter is realized as a Web Service using the SOAP messages described in the attached WSDL specifications.

## 5.4.1 Services Implemented by the CVCA/MBS

The CVCA/MBS has to implement a Web Service supporting the following messages:

- GetSectorPublicKey
- GetBlockList

## 5.4.2 Services Implemented by DVs

For the communication with its associated authentication terminals a DV has to implement a Web Service supporting the following messages:

- GetSectorPublicKey
- GetBlockList

If a DV supports callback messages sent by the CVCA/MBS, the Web Service of the DV MUST in addition also support the following (callback) messages:

• SendBlockList

## 5.4.3 Services Implemented by Authentication Terminals

An authentication terminal has to implement the corresponding Web Service only, if it supports callback messages sent by its DV. In this case it has to implement a Web Service supporting the following (callback) messages:

• SendBlockList

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>A Defect Lists

Defect Lists are signed lists to handle production error affecting a large number of documents. Defects are identified by the Document Signer Certificate(s) used to produce defect documents. Defect Lists are thus errata that not only inform about defects but also provides corrigenda to fix the error where possible.

Note that it is possible that a document does not contain a defect although the respective Document Signer Certificate is on the Defect List.

The object identifiers used in this appendix are contained in the subtree of bsi-de:

```
bsi-de OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 
 itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) 
 reserved(127) etsi-identified-organization(0) 7 
}
```
## A.1 Defect List Format

A Defect List SHALL be provided as BER encoded SignedData according Appendix [C](#page-32-0) with content type DefectList identified by id-DefectList:

```
id-DefectList{
 bsi-de applications(3) MRTD(1) 5}
}
DefectList ::= SEQUENCE {
 version INTEGER {v1(0)}
 hashAlg OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 defects SET OF Defect
}
Defect ::= SEQUENCE{
 signerIdentifier SignerIdentifier,
 certificateHash OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
 knownDefects SET OF KnownDefect
}
KnownDefect ::= SEQUENCE{
 defectType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 parameters ANY defined by defectType OPTIONAL
}
```
The data type SignerIdentifier is defined in [RFC 5652] as follows:

```
SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
 issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
 subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier
}
```
## A.1.1 Identification of Document Signer Certificates

There are two main options to reference the Document Signer Certificate in a Defect List, either by the distinguished name of the CSCA and the serial number of the Document Signer Certificate or by the Subject Key Identifier of the Document Signer Public Key. Those two options are augmented by a third option: If neither issuerAndSerialNumber nor the subjectKeyIdentifier uniquely identify the Document Signer (due to a defect in the certificate) the hash of the Document Signer Certificate MUST additionally be included. The hash function to be used is indicated in the Defect List.

## A.2 Defect Categories

Three groups of document defect types are currently distinguished:

- 1. Authentication Defects
- 2. Application Defects
- 3. Document Defects

The following section specify the object identifier for defects in those categories and the parameters describing workarounds for the defect.

Table [2](#page-26-0) specifies the content of three types of Defect Lists for different purposes:

- **Internal:** This defect list is used for internal purposes, in particular for border control. It MUST contain all known defects.
- **External:** This defect lists is used to inform other countries about defects in national documents in particular ePassports. It MUST NOT contain defects referring to foreign documents.
- **Commercial:** This defect list is used to inform private companies about defects in national documents. It SHOULD NOT contain defects referring to foreign documents.

| Defect Type              | Internal | External | Commercial |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Authentication           |          |          |            |

## A.2.1 Authentication Defects

This section describes defects related to Passive Authentication, Chip authentication, and Active Authentication. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-AuthDefect ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DefectList 1}

If a document is affected by an authentication defect (i.e. the defect is contained the sub-tree of id-AuthDefect) with unknown interpretation, the electronic part of the document MUST NOT be used.

#### A.2.1.1 Document Signer Certificate Revoked

The private key of the Document Signer is compromised (e.g. revoked by a CRL). The electronic part of the document MUST NOT be used.

Note that this defect is equivalent to an issued CRL containing the Document Signer. This type of defect can be used to revoke foreign Document Signers independent of the availability of a CRL issued by the respective CSCA.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides a status code (StatusCode) as parameter.

```
id-CertRevoked ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-AuthDefect 1}
StatusCode ::= ENUMERATED {
 noIndication(0), -- no details given
 onHold(1), -- revocation under investigation
 testing(2), -- the certificate has been used for testing purposes
 revokedByIssuer(3), -- the Issuer has revoked the certificate by CRL
 revokedDLS(4), -- the Defect List Signer has revoked the certificate
 proprietary(32) -- status codes >=32 can be used for internal purposes
}
```
#### A.2.1.2 Document Signer Certificate Malformed

The Document Signer Certificate cannot be decoded correctly using standardized mechanisms. A replacement certificate is provided.

Note that this certificate is not necessarily signed by the corresponding CSCA. Replacement Document Signer Certificates MAY be self-signed.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides a replacement certificate (Certificate, cf. [RFC 5280]) as parameter.

```
id-CertReplaced ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-AuthDefect 2}
```
#### A.2.1.3 Chip Authentication Private Keys Compromised

MalformedDGs ::= SET OF INTEGER -- DGs as integer
```
#### A.2.2.2 Document Security Object Malformed

The validation of the Document Security Object might fail (e.g. signature incorrect). In this case the electronic part of the document MUST NOT be used.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameters:

id-SODInvalid ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-ePassportDefect 2}

### A.2.3 Personalisation Defects of the eID Application

The following sections describe defects related to the personalisation of the eID application. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-eIDDefect ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DefectList 3}

If a document is affected by an personalization defect of the eID application (i.e. the defect is contained the sub-tree of id-eIDDefect) with unknown interpretation, the eID application SHOULD NOT be used.

#### A.2.3.1 Data Group Malformed

The indicated data groups might be incorrectly encoded. In this case the data group SHOULD be ignored.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides the malformed DGs (MalformedDGs) as parameter:

id-eIDDGMalformed ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-eIDDefect 1}

id-eIDIntegrity ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-eIDDefect 2}
```
## A.2.4 General Document Defects

The following sections describe defects related to the document in general. This category of defects is indicated by the following object identifier:

id-DocumentDefect ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DefectList 4}

If a document is affected by a general defect (i.e. the defect is contained the sub-tree of id-DocumentDefect) with unknown interpretation, the electronic part of the document SHOULD NOT be used.

## A.2.4.1 Card Security Object Malformed

The Card Security Object is incorrectly encoded. A corrected Card Security Object is provided that SHOULD be used instead.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It provides a corrected Card Security Object (id-SecurityObject, cf. [TR-03110-3], Appendix A.1.2.2 and A.1.2.5) as parameter:

id-CardSecurityMalformed ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DocumentDefect 1}

The Chip Security Object might be incorrectly encoded. The Card Security Object SHOULD be used instead.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameter:

id-ChipSecurityMalformed ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DocumentDefect 2}

#### A.2.4.2 Chip Security Object Malformed

The Chip Security Object might be incorrectly encoded. The Card Security Object SHOULD be used instead.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameter:

id-ChipSecurityMalformed ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DocumentDefect 2}

#### A.2.4.3 Powerdown Required

The chip denies multiple successive authentication using the General Authentication Procedure. Either the reader MUST powerdown the chip or the document MUST be removed from the reader in between two authentications.

This type of defect is indicated by the following object identifier. It does not provide any parameter:

id-PowerDownReq ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER{id-DocumentDefect 3}

# <span id="page-30-0"></span>B Block Lists

Restricted Identification (cf. [TR-03110-2], Section 3.6) is a mechanisms that allows to generate sectorspecific identifiers on the chip of the document. Those identifiers are used for the revocation of the document.

Block Lists are signed lists containing the sector-specific identifiers of revoked documents. As those identifiers are sector specific, a separate Block List is produced for every sector.

## <span id="page-30-1"></span>B.1 Block List Format

A Block List can be either a complete list containing all items or a delta list containing added or removed items. The block list SHOULD be provided as DER encoded SignedData according to [TR-03129-1] Appendix C with content type BlockList identified by id-BlockList:

```
id-BlockList OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
 bsi-de applications(3) eID(2) 2}
BlockList ::= SEQUENCE{
 version INTEGER{v2(1)},
 type INTEGER{complete(0),added(1),removed(2)},
 listID ListID,
 deltaBase ListID OPTIONAL, -- required for delta lists
 finalEntries INTEGER OPTIONAL, – required for delta lists
 content SEQUENCE OF BlockListDetails,
}
BlockListDetails ::= SEQUENCE{
 sectorID OCTET STRING,
 sectorSpecificIDs SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING
}
ListID ::= OCTET STRING
```
The data type ListID SHALL uniquely identify the block list. The exact format of this parameter (e.g. a sequence number or a time stamp over the corresponding block list) SHALL be determined by the block list provider.

For complete block lists deltaBase MUST be omitted. For delta lists deltaBase SHALL indicate the block list used to generate the added or removed items.

The field finalEntries contains the number of active revocations that should be in the system after the list has been processed. If the receiving system determines, that the number of entries in its own database does not match the number of entries reported by the superior system, then the data set should be reconsolidated.

## B.1.1 Block List Content

The content of BlockListDetails differs depending on the provider of the block list:

- If the block list is generated by the MBS it SHALL have the following content:
	- sectorID is the Revocation Sector.
	- sectorSpecificIDs are the transformed Restricted Identification public keys *PK ID Revocation* .
- After the DV has transformed the received block list for a specific Terminal Sector it SHALL have the following content:
	- sectorID is the respective Terminal Sector.
	- sectorSpecificIDs are the sector-specific identifiers *I ID Sector* .

The sector identifier SectorID SHALL be used to reference the public keys *PK Revocation* and *PKSector* using the service GetSectorPublicKey provided by the MBS and the DVs, respectively. The format of the sector identifier is defined by the Block List Provider, it is RECOMMENDED to use a hash of the public key.

All public keys in SectorSpecificIDs SHALL be contained as plain public key values, i.e. excluding the domain parameters. For Elliptic Curve Public Keys the uncompressed encoding MUST be used.

# <span id="page-32-0"></span>C Signed Data Profile

Block Lists and Defect Lists are provided as Signed Data according to [RFC 5652]. The following profile SHALL be used.
