### Introduction

On the one hand, digital signatures as well as time-stamps based on cryptographic mechanisms are increasingly used in our everyday life and are a major cornerstone for electronic commerce.

On the other hand, it is well known, that the strength and suitability of cryptographic mechanisms is a function of time and one needs to apply suitable preservation mechanisms, which are able to maintain the validity status of a signed object over long periods of time, which may involve the application of different storage technologies and cryptographic algorithms.

The need for long-term preservation is acknowledged amongst others in the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market [[i.2\]](#page-7-0), as can be seen in recital (61):

"*This Regulation should ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to ensure the legal validity of electronic signatures and electronic seals over extended periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.*"

Furthermore Article 34 of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [\[i.2\]](#page-7-0) states that "*a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified trust service provider that uses procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological validity period*" and that "*the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of standards for the qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures.*".

The present document is aiming to meet the general requirements of the international community to provide trust and confidence in preservation services which can be used to preserve the validity status of digital signatures or to provide a proof of existence of digital objects using digital signature techniques, including, amongst others, applicable requirements from Articles 34 and 40 of Regulation (EU) N 910/2014 [\[i.2\]](#page-7-0) that establishes a legal framework for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures and mutatis mutandis for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals.

### <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 Scope

The present document builds on the general policy requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 401 [[1\]](#page-7-0), specifies policy and security requirements for trust service providers providing long-term preservation of digital signatures and of general data, i.e. signed data or unsigned data, using digital signature techniques.

The present document aims at supporting preservation services in different regulatory frameworks.

Specifically, but not exclusively, the preservation service addressed in the present document aims at supporting qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures or seals as per Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [\[i.2\]](#page-7-0).

Specifically, but not exclusively, digital signatures in the present document cover electronic signatures, advanced electronic signatures, qualified electronic signatures, electronic seals, advanced electronic seals, and qualified electronic seals as per Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [[i.2](#page-7-0)].

The present document addresses two main cases:

- 1) The preservation **over long periods of time, using digital signature techniques**, of the **ability to validate a digital signature,** of the ability **to maintain its validity status** and of the ability **to get a proof of existence** of the associated signed data as they were at the time of the submission to the preservation service even if later the signing key becomes compromised, the certificate expires, or cryptographic attacks become feasible on the signature algorithm or the hash algorithm used in the submitted signature.
- NOTE 1: A qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures or seals as per Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [[i.2\]](#page-7-0) for which the status of the technical validity needs to be preserved, is covered in this case.
- NOTE 2: The validity status of a signature means the status of the signature that will not change over time. Such a status may be valid (TOTAL\_PASSED according to ETSI EN 319 102-1 [[i.6](#page-7-0)]) or invalid (TOTAL\_FAILED and certain cases for INDETERMINATE according to ETSI EN 319 102-1 [\[i.6](#page-7-0)]).
- NOTE 3: "Digital signature techniques" designates techniques based on digital signatures, time-stamps or evidence records.
- 2) The provision of a proof of existence of digital objects, whether they are signed or not, **using digital signature techniques** (digital signatures, time-stamp tokens, evidence records, etc.).
- NOTE 4: In this case, even if the main object to be preserved is a signature, it is treated in the same way as any other file.
- NOTE 5: A proof of existence of digital object not using digital signature techniques is not in the scope of the present document.

The present document covers different strategies for the preservation service. The applicable requirements depend on the strategy chosen by the preservation service.

- EXAMPLE 1: The preservation service can provide storage, no storage, or temporary storage.
- EXAMPLE 2: The preservation service can receive the digital signature, the signed data, the revocation information or only hash values and evidences.

The present document identifies specific controls needed to address specific risks associated with preservation services.

The transformation of the original data into another data object with equivalent object content and semantic to avoid the risk that the original data object/viewer system is becoming obsolete is out of the scope of the present document.

### 4 General Concepts

#### 4.1 Preservation storage models

#### 4.1.1 Overview

Three preservation storage models for the preservation service are distinguished:

- 1) **Preservation services with storage [WST].** In this case, the data to be preserved is stored by the preservation service while the evidences and the preserved data are delivered upon request by the preservation service to the preservation client. The preservation service stores the submitted data object(s) (SubDO(s)) and the preservation object(s) (PO(s)) and the associated preservation evidences. The PO(s) are derived from the SubDo(s) by augmentation or by building a Preservation Object Container (POC). Specific requirements, recommendations or permissions for this case are marked by [WST], see clause [3.4.](#page-12-0)
- 2) **Preservation services with temporary storage [WTS].** In this case, the data to be preserved is stored on the client side. The preservation service keeps the data or a hash of the data to be preserved only temporarily at latest until the evidence is produced. Evidences are produced asynchronously. Once they are produced, the evidences are stored during some time period to allow the client to retrieve them. Specific requirements, recommendations or permissions for this case are marked by [WTS], see clause [3.4.](#page-12-0)
- EXAMPLE: Evidences records can be produced daily using the hash values of the data to be preserved that has been presented during 24 hours.
- 3) **Preservation services without storage [WOS].** In this case, the data to be preserved is stored on the client side. The preservation service neither stores the SubDO nor the preservation evidences. Evidences are produced synchronously and are included in the response. The preservation service only keeps traces of its actions to be able to provide records of its activities. Specific requirements, recommendations or permissions for this case are marked by [WOS], see clause [3.4](#page-12-0).

Depending on the preservation storage model, the service will implement different processes. The three models are shown in figures [1](#page-14-0), [2](#page-15-0) and [3](#page-16-0).

### <span id="page-14-0"></span>4.1.2 Preservation service with storage [WST]

#### **Figure 1: Functional model of a preservation service with storage [WST]**

The preservation protocol allows the preservation client to interact with the preservation interface.

A preservation service with storage stores the SubDO and the preservation object(s) (PO(s)) derived from the SubDO(s) by augmentation or building a Preservation Object Container (POC) and produces preservation evidences upon request according to a preservation profile that has been previously selected. The preservation client of the submitter submits one or more SubDO(s) to the preservation service and receives back a preservation object identifier. Afterwards, during the preservation period, the preservation client is able to retrieve upon request one or more preservation evidence(s) and/or Preservation Objects (POs). The preservation service provides the possibility to delete the stored PO(s). In case of the deletion of preservation evidences the corresponding SubDOs and derived POs are to be deleted as well. According to the preservation profile that has been previously selected, the preservation service can keep the preservation evidences when deleting the SubDOs, but not the other way around, until the end of the preservation period.

A preservation service with storage can allow to provide a new version of an already submitted PO. The link between different versions is covered in the POC. Such a functionality allows to specify the difference to the previous version.

The preservation service can contact external TSPs to retrieve information needed to create the preservation evidences. Such services can be Certificate Status Authorities (CSA), Time-Stamping Authorities (TSA), digital Signature creation Service (SigS) or Validation Services (ValS) or archival service.

The preservation service uses an internal or external TSA in producing the preservation evidences.

The preservation service monitors the cryptographic algorithms used within the stored preservation evidences (see clause 7.14) and augments the preservation evidences, if needed (see clause 7.15).

![](_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)

### <span id="page-15-0"></span>4.1.3 Preservation service with temporary storage [WTS]

#### **Figure 2: Functional model of a preservation service with temporary storage [WTS]**

The preservation protocol allows the preservation client to interact with the preservation interface.

A preservation service with temporary storage temporarily stores one or more SubDO(s) or one or more submitted hash value(s) received by the preservation client until the preservation evidence(s) are made available for retrieval by the client and then deletes them.

The preservation service makes evidences asynchronously available after a time period according to the preservation profile. Once a preservation service has produced the evidences, they can be obtained upon request during the preservation evidence retention period.

The preservation service can contact external TSPs to retrieve information needed to create the preservation evidences. Such services can be Certificate Status Authorities (CSA), Time-Stamping Authorities (TSA), Signature or Seal creation Service (SigS) or Validation Services (ValS).

The preservation service uses an internal or external TSA in producing the preservation evidences.

The preservation service monitors the cryptographic algorithms used within its active profiles (see clause 7.14) and changes the set of applicable algorithms if needed. The preservation evidences are created according to the active profiles and augmented, if needed (see clause 7.15).

![](_page_16_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-16-0"></span>4.1.4 Preservation service without storage [WOS]

#### **Figure 3: Functional model of a preservation service without storage [WOS]**

The preservation protocol allows the preservation client to interact with the preservation interface.

A preservation service without storage neither stores the data to be preserved nor a hash of the data nor evidences. It produces evidences synchronously according to the preservation profile.

The submitter submits one or more a SubDO(s) and immediately retrieves a response with one or more preservation evidence(s) for it (synchronous mode).

The preservation service monitors the cryptographic algorithms used within its active profiles (see clause 7.14) and changes the set of applicable algorithms if needed. The preservation evidences are created according to the active profiles.

The preservation service can contact external TSPs to retrieve information needed to create the preservation evidences. Such services can be Certificate Status Authorities (CSA), Time-Stamping Authorities (TSA), Signature or Seal creation Service (SigS) or validation services (ValS).

The preservation service uses an internal or external TSA in producing the preservation evidences.

### 4.2 Functional goals

Different scenarios for preservation services can be distinguished, each having specific security and policy requirements. A preservation service can provide:

- 1) the provision of proofs of existence over long periods of time of general data whether this data is signed or not;
- 2) the preservation over long periods of time of the ability to validate a digital signature, to maintain its validity status and to get a proof of existence of the associated signed data; and/or
- 3) the augmentation of preservation evidence submitted to the preservation service.

In the first case, the goal of a preservation service is to produce evidence that data or a collection of data indeed have not been altered and existed at a certain time.

Specific requirements, recommendations or permissions for this care are marked by [PGD], see clause [3.4](#page-12-0).

In the second case, the ability to validate a digital signature and to maintain its validity status is obtained by making sure that all needed validation data is collected, verified and protected using digital signature techniques.

- NOTE 1: ETSI EN 319 102-1 [\[i.6\]](#page-7-0) defines different validation statuses (TOTAL\_VALID, TOTAL\_FAILED, INDETERMINATE).
- NOTE 2: The main difference between the first and the second case is that in the second date the validation data corresponding to the signature is preserved as well, see **OVR-9.3-03** in clause 9.3.

These evidences provide a proof of existence of the digital signature and the validation data (time-stamps, certification paths, revocation information), and also a proof of existence of the signed data in case the signed data is provided together with the signature. The validation data can be included either in the information submitted to the preservation service, or can be obtained by the preservation service. The present document does not give any restrictions on how the validation data is collected and protected in the preservation evidence.

NOTE 3: The validation data can be included directly into the evidence or into a validation report.

NOTE 4: The preservation service is not a signature validation service. It can use a signature validation service to create a validation report, or to make sure that all needed validation data is collected and verified, but this is not needed, as long as it collects, verifies and protects all the validation data needed to preserve the ability to validate the digital signature and to maintain its validity status over long periods of time.

In case all the needed validation data cannot be collected and verified by the preservation service, the preservation profile indicates how the preservation service will react. Possible strategies for the preservation service are:

- to indicate a failure; or
- to preserve all the information it can collect; or
- if possible, try to collect missing validation data at a later point in time.

Specific requirements, recommendations or permissions for this case are marked by [PDS], see clause [3.4.](#page-12-0)

A preservation service can also provide both, extending the validity status of submitted digital signatures and at the same time providing a proof of existence for the other submitted data [PDS+PGD].

In addition to the first two cases, the preservation service can support an augmentation goal of submitted preservation evidences. In this case, the preservation service allows the client to submit one or more preservation evidence(s) which will then be augmented by the preservation service, if needed.

- EXAMPLE 1: The preservation service allows to receive an evidence record created by a different preservation service, and the protected data, and will continue the preservation of the data by augmenting the originally submitted preservation evidence.
- NOTE 5: For a preservation service with storage, the augmentation of preservation evidence during the preservation period is independent of the "augmentation goal", since it augments internally stored preservation evidence(s) and not submitted preservation evidence(s).

A preservation service can support the augmentation goal alone or in combination with other goals.

The mapping between the signed documents(s) and their hashes used within the signature(s) is essential when preserving a signature.

EXAMPLE 2: In Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [\[i.2\]](#page-7-0) the link between the signed document and the signature is part of the conditions for an advanced electronic signature/seal.

However due to confidentiality, privacy or performance reasons there are use cases where it is preferable to submit only the hashes of the signed documents to the preservation service. In this case, the preservation of the signed document falls out of the control and responsibility of the preservation service. The preservation service is only responsible for the preservation of the submitted hashes. The proof of existence of the hash value gives a proof of the existence of the hashed object as long as the hash algorithm is considered strong enough. A preservation service might provide the possibility to send new hash values of the signed document before the originally used hash algorithm becomes week. These values can for example be used to do a hash-tree renewal or update an evidence. However, again in this case the preservation service is only responsible for the preservation of the submitted hashes, it has no way of checking if the new hash values are related to the originally provided ones.

### <span id="page-18-0"></span>4.3 Preservation service applicable documentation

#### 4.3.1 Preservation service practice statement

The PSP develops, implements, enforces, and updates a preservation practice statements which is a trust service practice statement such as defined in ETSI EN 319 401 [\[1](#page-7-0)], instantiated for a preservation service. See clause 6.1.

The preservation service practice statements describe *how* the PSP operates its service and is owned by the PSP. The recipients of the practice statements can be the auditors, the subscribers and the relying parties.

NOTE: The presence of some elements is mandatory in the preservation service practice statement as requested in the present document, however the present document places no restriction on the form of the preservation service practice statement; it can be included in a general TSP practice statement document that covers other services delivered by that TSP or a standalone document.

The present document provides requirements identified as necessary to support a high-level preservation service policy, to be endorsed by a PSP and reflected in its practice statements.

#### 4.3.2 Preservation service policy

A preservation service policy describes *what* is offered and can contain diverse information beyond the scope of the present document to indicate the applicability of the service.

The recipients of the service policy can be auditors, the subscribers and the relying parties. It contains the rules to follow in providing the service. However, it is not limited to the technical description as provided in the preservation profile, but covers also more general requirements on the service management and the operation.

The present document can be referred by such preservation service policy to provide information about the level of the service.

PSPs conforming to the present document's normative requirements except those from annex A may use in its documentation the following specific OID:

• itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) pres-service-policies(19511) policy-identifiers(1) main (1).

PSPs conforming to the present document's normative requirements including those defined in annex A may use in its documentation the following specific OID:

• itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) pres-service-policies(19511) policy-identifiers(1) qualified (2).

According to ETSI EN 319 401 [\[1](#page-7-0)] it is mandatory for a TSP to identify the service policies it supports. For preservation services, such identifier is communicated through the documentation provided to the subscribers and relying parties.

A preservation service policy is not necessarily part of the SP's documentation (as per ETSI EN 319 401 [[1\]](#page-7-0) a practice statement and general terms and conditions are sufficient); e.g. a preservation service policy can be shared by a community and not owned by the PSP. Also, the present document does not put constraints on the form of the preservation service policy; a preservation service policy can be a stand-alone document or be provided as part of or referenced by the practice statements and/or the general terms and conditions.

#### 4.3.3 Preservation schemes and preservation profiles

A preservation scheme is a generic set of procedures and rules pertinent to a preservation storage model and one or more preservation goals which outlines how preservation evidences are created and validated. It can be supported by one or more preservation profiles.

A preservation profile identifies a set of implementation details specifying how preservation evidences are generated and validated and which are pertinent to a preservation storage model and one or more preservation goals. A preservation profile can reference a preservation scheme for specification of general rules.

EXAMPLE 1: ETSI TS 119 512 [\[i.13](#page-8-0)] annex G contains examples of preservation schemes.

<span id="page-19-0"></span>A given preservation service can implement different preservation profiles. Each preservation profile is uniquely identifiable.

- EXAMPLE 2: The unique identification can be done using an URI (absolute or using relative), see IETF RFC 3986 [\[i.19](#page-8-0)].
- EXAMPLE 3: The unique identification can be done using an OID or URI and a version and a date from which the specific version is applicable.

The content of the preservation profile is described in clause [6.4](#page-22-0).

#### 4.3.4 Preservation evidence policy

The preservation evidence policy is referenced by the preservation profile. It contains all the information about how preservation evidences are created and how they can be validated.

```
NOTE: See OVR-6.4-04 c)-a.
```
#### 4.3.5 Signature validation policy

In case of preservation of digital signatures where the preservation service collects the validation data needed to determine the status of the digital signature, the signature validation policy is referenced in the preservation profile. In this case, the validation policy describes the rules followed to obtain the validation data.

NOTE: See **OVR-6.4-04** c)-b.

### 4.4 Expected evidence duration

The expected evidence duration applies for a preservation service with temporary storage or without storage.

It is a duration during which or a date until which, the preservation service expects that a preservation evidence can be used to achieve the preservation goal. This means that the preservation evidence can still be verified and provides cryptographical protection. For several preservation evidence formats, e.g. evidence records or archival AdES signatures, it is sufficient to be able to successfully validate the latest time-stamp of the whole preservation evidence.

For preservation evidences generated using digital signature techniques, several durations need to be considered:

- 1) the private key validity period, i.e. the pre-determined time period during which the private key can be used to generate evidences, unless the associated certificate has been revoked for any reason;
- 2) the certificate validity period;
- 3) the duration during which the certificate revocation requests are managed, i.e. a certificate can be revoked;
- 4) the duration during which the revocation information remains available;
- 5) the duration during which the hash functions are resistant to collision attacks; and
- 6) the duration during which the public key is resistant to cryptographic attacks.

For public key certificates conformant to IETF RFC 5280 [\[i.21\]](#page-8-0), the certificate can only be revoked during the certificate validity period.

For public key certificates conformant to IETF RFC 5280 [\[i.21](#page-8-0)], the revocation information is available at least until the end of the validity period of the certificate. However, a CA can provide revocation information also after the expiration of a certificate.

EXAMPLE: For qualified certificates, as defined by the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [[i.2\]](#page-7-0), the revocation information is provided beyond the validity period of the certificate, see article 24 point 4 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [[i.2](#page-7-0)].

An evidence generated using time assertions (time-stamps or evidence records) needs to be validated by building a certification path up to a trust anchor.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>NOTE: A trust anchor can be at the top of a CA hierarchy or any CA certificate in a CA hierarchy.

A preservation evidence can be validated as long as:

- 1) none of the certificates from the certification path has been revoked for the reason 'key compromise';
- 2) no public key present in the validation data is subject to cryptographic attacks; and
- 3) none of the hash functions used in the validation data is subject to collision attacks.

Point 1) can be verified as long as revocation information is available.

If the private key and all backup copies of it are effectively destroyed at the end of the private key validity period, then the only way to compromise the private key will be to perform a successful cryptographic attack on the corresponding public key or on one of the hash functions being used.

The expected evidence duration reflects an estimation of a date for the resistance of both the digital signature algorithms and the hash functions used in the validation data for the last preservation evidence.

The technological validity period corresponds to a time period during which a signature or evidence can be successful validated and trusted. It depends on until when the certification path can be verified and until when the cryptographic algorithms hashing and signature can be trusted. The technological validity period of signature is similar to the expected evidence duration of preservation evidence based on digital signature techniques.

### 4.5 Preservation period

In the case of a preservation service with storage [WST], the preservation period is the duration during which the preservation service preserves the preservation objects (POs). The POs may consist of the submitted data objects (SubDO) and POs derived from the submitted data objects by augmentation or by building a POC including the associated evidences.

This preservation period can be defined using a duration period (e.g. in years) from the time of the submission, from legally required retention periods, by a criterion, or by a date. During that period, the preservation service creates and augments preservation evidences as needed to achieve the preservation goal. The way evidences are created may change during this period because for example certificates expire or because a cryptographic algorithm is not trustworthy anymore. The preservation service can use external sources of information to appreciate which cryptographic algorithms, key sizes or hash functions are not likely to be trustworthy anymore, e.g. ETSI TS 119 312 [\[i.5](#page-7-0)], and when necessary issue a new (version of a) preservation profile.

**OVR-9.3-02 [PDS][PDS+PGD] [CONDITIONAL]:** If the validation data is submitted by the preservation client, the preservation service should verify the submitted validation data according to the signature validation policy supported by the preservation profile (see clause 6.6), and verify that the submitted validation data is appropriate, otherwise it should collect and verify the appropriate validation data.

**OVR-9.3-03 [PDS]:** To extend the ability to validate a digital signature and to maintain its validity status, the preservation service shall, at the minimum, provide a proof of existence of the signature and of the validation data needed to validate the signature using digital signature techniques (digital signatures, time-stamps, evidence records). NOTE 1: A proof of existence of a detached signature provides also a proof of existence of the signed data at as long algorithms, e.g. the hash function used in the original signature is resistant against collision attacks.

**OVR-9.3-04 [PDS+PGD]:** To extend the ability to validate a digital signature and to maintain its validity status, the preservation service shall, on one side, provide a proof of existence of the signature and of the validation data needed to validate the signature and on the other side a proof of existence of the signed data.

- NOTE 2: The present document gives no restrictions on the way the preservation service obtains the validation data needed to validate the signature.

**OVR-9.3-05 [PDS][PDS+PGD] [CONDITIONAL]:** In the case of a detached signature, the preservation service may allow the preservation subscriber to provide only a hash value of the signed data instead of the signed data itself.

**OVR-9.3-06 [PDS][PDS+PGD] [CONDITIONAL]:** In case of a detached signature and if the preservation service allows the preservation subscriber to provide only a hash value of the signed data, the PSP shall indicate in the preservation profile the identifiers of the hash functions that can be used.

**OVR-9.3-07 [PDS][PDS+PGD] [CONDITIONAL]:** In case of a detached signature and if the preservation service allows the preservation subscriber to provide only a hash value of the signed data, the preservation service shall treat the hash value (associated with a hash function identifier) as a general data linked somehow to the signature, since it has no way of knowing if the hash value really corresponds to the signed data.

NOTE 3: In this case, the preservation service is only responsible for the preservation of the submitted hash value (associated with a hash function identifier).

**OVR-9.3-08 [PDS][PDS+PGD] [CONDITIONAL]:** In case of a detached signature and if the preservation service allows the preservation subscriber to provide only a hash value of the signed data, the preservation service shall verify that the submitted preservation object contains hash function identifiers that are in accordance with the identifiers of the hash functions listed in the preservation profile and that each hash value has a length in accordance with the associated hash function identifier.

## <span id="page-34-0"></span>Annex C (informative): Differences and relationships between an archival service and a preservation service

## C.1 Archival services

When managing records within an archival service there are three different stages for the life cycle:

- 1) **Current records:** In this phase the records are created updated and/or linked together. During this phase, a workflow application is often used to manage the records.
- 2) **Semi-current or intermediary records:** Once records become stable, i.e. they are not changed anymore, they can be transferred to an archival system. Metadata is included into the records for two main reasons:
	- a) to be able to identify the records that correspond to some search criteria so that they can be retrieved; and
	- b) to be able to identify the records that have reached their **disposal phase** where the records can either be deleted, transferred to an historical archiving system and kept longer.
- 3) **Historical records:** Such records are selected for a permanent archival usually based on grounds of their cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. In this case, the time period of archival is "forever". The metadata included into the records is used to find out one or more records which correspond to some search criteria for the purpose of accessing to these records.

When a record is presented to an intermediary archival service, the archival service adds metadata to the record so that the date of the archival can be known, as well as an identifier of the entity which made the deposit.

EXAMPLE: In France, an archival system may use cryptographic techniques to provide proofs of existence of the data, but it is not mandatory to do so. In such a case, it may use the services of a preservation service as described in the present document.

## C.2 Preservation services

There are three main categories of Preservation Services:

- 1) with storage;
- 2) without storage; or
- 3) with temporary storage.

A Preservation Service with storage may look similar to an Archival Service because both services support a storage functionality.

A Preservation Service with storage keeps the submitted preservation objects and the associated evidences into storage during a preservation period. The preservation service provides the functionality to delete the preservation objects before the end of the preservation period.

EXAMPLE: In Germany, before deleting a PO, all federal and state public bodies are legally required to offer documents that are no longer needed for carrying out tasks to the Federal or State Archive to be taken over as federal/state archive material. This duty to offer also applies to electronic documents. Because archiving is not the subject of this technical specification, however, the corresponding legal requirements will not be described in more detail.

Preservation services as described in the present document use digital signature techniques.

<span id="page-35-0"></span>There are two possible preservation goals:

- 1) extending over long periods of time the ability to validate a digital signature and to maintain its validity status; and
- 2) providing proofs of existence of data over long periods of time.

To be able to extend over long periods of time the validity status of a digital signature the preservation service needs to provide a proof of existence of:

- 1) the signature;
- 2) the signed data; and
- 3) the validation data (certificate paths, revocation information).
- NOTE: The proof of existence of the signed data can be indirectly done by a proof of existence of the signature, as long as the signature can still be trusted to provide proof of integrity of the signed data, i.e. the hash algorithm and the cryptographic algorithm used to create the signature can still be trusted.

## C.3 Comparison of archival services with preservation services

For a digital archival service, the demonstration of a proof of existence can be based on an audit of the archival service against some criteria, e.g. ISO 14721:2012 [[i.16\]](#page-8-0), ISO 16363 [\[i.17\]](#page-8-0), ISO 14641-1:2018 [[i.15\]](#page-8-0) or other similar norms.

For a preservation service as defined in the present document, the demonstration of a proof of existence will be based on two factors:

- 1) an audit of the Preservation service against some criteria, e.g. the present document; and
- 2) the use of digital signature techniques to demonstrate that some data has not been modified since a given date.

A digital archival service may use digital signature techniques to provide proofs of existence for some data but is not required to use them.

A preservation service can be part of an archival service.

A difference between a preservation service and an archival service is that an archival service without a preservation service does not capture nor verify any validation data associated with a digital signature.

## C.4 Relationships between archival services and preservation services

A digital archival service can use a preservation service to provide proofs of existence of data based on digital signature techniques. It needs to manage all the metadata required by an archival service.

A preservation service with storage (WST) can use an archival service for the goal of storing data.

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>Annex D (informative): Cryptographic threats and countermeasures

## D.1 Risks based on collision attacks of one-way hash functions used within a digital signature

A digital signature, used in connection with a time assertion, uses a one-way collision resistant hash function used to compute a hash value which is signed by the signer's private key. In such a way, the digital signature protects the integrity of the hash value. Such one-way collision resistant hash functions can become weak on the long term. In this case, it might then be possible to find another signed data that would lead to the same hash value, and the integrity of the signed data cannot be guaranteed anymore. This principle applies to digital signatures submitted by the user, but also for any digital signature/time-stamp created by external trust service providers or the preservation service itself which are included by the preservation service within a preservation evidence.

There are various strategies to address the case where the one-way collision resistant hash function becomes weak which was originally used to compute the hash value signed under the signer's private key.

In case the preservation service has access to the signed data it can compute a new digital signature or time assertion based on a new hash value of the signed data, calculated with a suitable hash algorithm and suitable parameters, to guarantee the integrity and proof of existence of the signed data before the original hash algorithm becomes weak.

In case the preservation submitter only submitted the hash of the digitally signed data to the preservation service, e.g. because it is very large or due to privacy reasons, the preservation service cannot recompute on its own a new hash of the signed data. The client may submit two hash values computed by two different hash algorithms, based on different mathematical principles, to reduce the risk of possible collision attacks. In any case, the preservation service cannot know if the hash value(s) corresponds to the signed data, and can treat them only as arbitrary data related to the signature.

In the general case it is much more difficult, but not impossible, to find a collision for two such algorithms.

- NOTE 1: ETSI TS 119 312 [\[i.5\]](#page-7-0) gives recommendations on suitable hash algorithms.
- NOTE 2: In case the preservation submitter only submitted the hash of the signed data, proof of existence of the signed data falls out of the control and responsibility of the Preservation Service. The preservation client is responsible for the creation of the submitted digests and the preservation of the signed data.

## D.2 Risks based on the digital signature algorithm and key length

A digital signature uses an asymmetric signature algorithm based on a key pair of a specific key length. Due to development in cryptography it might be possible that at some moment in time it cannot be guaranteed anymore that the private key by which a specific signature was created, is still private and secret. This problem can be avoided if the digital signature including the certificate is covered by a time assertion that proves that it already existed before a specific time from which such an attack became possible.

However, some time assertions rely upon mechanisms that will be subject to the same problems. To counter this problem, time assertions are protected by obtaining a new time-stamp that covers the original data, its time-stamps and the corresponding validation data prior to the compromise of mechanisms used to generate the time assertions.

This principle applies to digital signatures submitted by the preservation submitter, but also for any digital signature/time assertions which are included within a preservation evidence.

### <span id="page-37-0"></span>D.3 Risks based on the revocation of a signing key

The revocation of a certificate states that the usage of the private key cannot be trusted anymore, e.g. because the (access to) the private key was stolen.

To be able to trust that a digital signature was created by the signer, the certificate needs to be checked that it was not revoked at the moment of signing or before. This can be done by using revocation information, like CRLs or OCSP responses, of the certificate. The preservation service captures and protects revocation information in the preservation evidence, using a proof of existence over it, to avoid problems because revocation information is not available anymore.

NOTE 1: To prove that a certificate was not revoked at a certain time, a proof of existence of the signature is needed in addition to the revocation information.

This principle applies to digital signatures submitted by the preservation submitter as well as to any digital signature/time-stamp created by external trust service providers or the preservation service itself and which are included by the preservation service within a preservation evidence.

In the general case, revocation information is available as long as a certificate is not expired. However, a CA can also provide it after the expiration date of the certificate.

NOTE 2: In case of qualified certificates in the context of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [\[i.2](#page-7-0)] revocation information is provided beyond the validity period of the certificates.
