# <span id="page-3-0"></span>1 Introduction

The business of Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) is a business of trust.

A PKI is used either to keep information secret or to determine the authenticity and integrity of information. So the question is, how trustworthy are the tools used to reach a certain level of confidentiality, authenticity and integrity? And, is the originator respectively the recipient of the information trustworthy?

In a Public Key Infrastructure the Certification Authority (CA) shall provide the answer to both questions. This requires that the CA itself is trustworthy and trusted by the relying parties.

To achieve trust, two conditions have to be fulfilled. At first a basis has to be built which legitimates the trust. This is achieved by the CA implementing organizational and technical security measures for an appropriate security level and defining rules for all entities participating in a PKI.

In a second step the deployment of the security measures has to be documented in a transparent and comparable way, to build trust with potential customers. That can be achieved by passing an audit based on clear and documented requirements, performed by a trusted, independent auditor and certified by a trusted certification body.

This document aims to support CAs on both steps, as it defines requirements for Certificate Authorities for implementing secure CA operation and it builds a basis for a audit and certification process.

# 1.1 Audit and Certification

It will be possible for CAs to be certified according to ISO/IEC 27001 using this document as sector-specific requirements. This implies that the scope of the ISMS of the CA includes the entire CA operation.

## 1.2 Scope and structure of this document

The document at hand is Part 1 of the 'Secure CA operation' document series compiling requirements for Trust Center instantiating as Certification Authority (CA) in Public Key infrastructures (PKI) with a security level 'high'. It considers generic requirements for secure CA operation. The other documents of the series consider additional or modified requirements for special exemplary business cases of a PKI.

To support comprehensibility and plausibility of the security requirements, and thereby increasing chances to get them accurately and consistently fulfilled, this document is based on a top-down approach. Beginning with the main goal of each CA, namely to provide trust, then regarding the processes of the CA and finally considering general security requirements, such as physical protection of the servers. The dependencies of items are explained in each subchapter: A first table lists the aims, processes and requirements which are maintained by the process or requirement defined in that subchapter, a second table shows the requirements and processes the item of the subchapter is depending on.

In order to show which security requirements are needed, every process or procedure is analyzed and corresponding threats and requirements are stated. This is followed by justifying the requirements as being appropriate for the threats.

To enable the balance between flexibility and precision, so called selections and assignments are used. These are to be filled in by the CA, thereby enforcing a specification of a single procedure, but also allowing different solutions within defined limits. This mechanism is very important to ensure that there are no regulations which are not realizable or just baseless, since this would weaken the whole complex of requirements.

This document is structured in the following way:

- Chapter 2 comprises definitions and abbreviations in PKI and CA context.
- Chapter 3 presents the state-of-the-art approach of a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).
- Chapter 4 contains the aims and abstract utilities of a CA.
- Chapter 5 defines the processes involved in the key- and certificate-management life-cycle of a CA.
- Chapter 6 adds general requirements for a secure CA operation.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>3 Concept and approach

The purpose of a Public-Key Infrastructure is to exchange trust, between parties which do not know each other. PKI is based on the concept of having trust in entities because they are trusted by an entity which is trustworthy. In a hierarchically organized PKI[1](#page-7-1) the Certification Authority is the topmost instance and is known and trusted by all other members of the PKI.

The most important tool within the PKI concept is the certificate, it is the certification of trust in the certificate holder by the CA. The certificate contains the unique name of the certificate holder, the electronic verifiable signature of the CA and the public key of the certificate holder, as well as some information on the use of the certificate. The public key can be used to encrypt digital data to be decrypted solely by the certificate holder, or to verify an electronic signature generated by the certificate holder.

A PKI consists of:

- the CA who manages the exchange of trust, defines the rules and checks the observance of the rules;
- the relying parties who trust in or rely on the subscriber certificates disseminated by the CA;
- the subscribers who are the certificate holders and subscribe to the CA, a subscriber can also be a relying party at the same time;
- all other persons, organizations, IT systems, data, buildings and infrastructure needed for the business of the CA.

A CA can either act as a topmost instance (a so called Root-CA) or as a subordinate instance (a so called Sub- -CA). The Root-CA is the anchor of trust within the PKI and signs its own certificates. Furthermore, it either signs and disseminates end entity certificates or, and this is the general case, signs and disseminates one or more Sub-CA certificates. A Sub-CA relies on the Root-CA and usually signs and disseminates end entity certificates. PKI hierarchies can also comprise more than one level of Sub-CA's. This document considers both CA roles.

[Figure 1](#page-8-0) shows the structure of this document, based on the aims, procedures and processes of a CA:

<span id="page-7-1"></span><sup>1</sup> Although there are many different structures of PKI, this document only considers hierarchical PKIs.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>4 Certification Authority as trustee in PKI

The main purpose of a Certification Authority (CA) is to moderate trust between the subscribers and other PKI members. The CA acts as a trustee of trust towards the other involved parties and issues certifications of trust for the subscribers of the CA.

To fulfill its main purpose, the CA shall reach the following objectives:

- CA.Obj.1 **['Trustworthy CA certificate'](#page-9-2):** Every digital certificate, i.e. *certification of trust, issued by the CA is signed with the private key of the CA and shall be verifiable by the relying parties of the* PKI. Therefore the CA shall issue the ['Trustworthy CA certificate'](#page-9-2) corresponding to its private key and disseminate it to the relying parties. The CA certificate is the digital trust anchor of the PKI.
- CA.Obj.2 **['Provision of trust services to relying parties'](#page-9-1)**: A CA shall provide trust services to its relying parties, which consists in ensuring the availability and trustability of the certificates which are issued as certifications of trust to the subscribers.

The Root-CA can issue and disseminate Sub-CA certificates for each Sub-CA controlling a branch of the PKI. As the business of Root-CA and Sub-CA is very similar, almost all objectives, threats and requirements specified in the document at hand apply to both. Therefore, the general term CA is used in this document. For the few aspects which might differ, it will be mentioned explicitly.

### <span id="page-9-2"></span>4.1 Trustworthy CA certificate

The trustworthy CA certificate is the digital trust anchor of the CA. It is used for the verification of every signature generated by the CA, therefore it shall be disseminated to all relying parties.

# <span id="page-10-1"></span>5.1 Private key of the CA

An integrity protected, authentic and confidential CA private key forms the basis for a trustworthy Certification Authority in a PKI. The CA private key is used by the Certification Authority to sign certificates in the ['Certificate generation process'](#page-32-0) (cf. section [5.5\)](#page-32-0) or to sign certificate revocation lists or issue OCSP signers during the ['Revocation and suspension'](#page-39-0) process (cf. section [5.7\)](#page-39-0).

Note that a CA may use separate key pairs corresponding to CA certificates to sign certificates, revocation lists and to issue OCSP signers. In this case those public keys should be signed with the private key of the CA[2](#page-10-2) .

The CA shall ensure that a CA key pair (in particular a CA private key) is maintained securely. This implies that the generation, storage and use of CA private keys must be strongly integrity protected, authentic and confidential.

| Maintaining                      | Rationale                                                                       |

| (cf. sec. 4.1)                   | and confidential a 'Trustworthy CA certificate' can be maintained.              |

#### 5.1.1 Objectives

For ['Private key of the CA',](#page-10-1) the following objectives need to be considered in a secure CA operation.

- <span id="page-10-5"></span>PRC.Obj.1: A CA key pair shall only be generated with the knowledge of a responsible representative of the certification authority's legal body.
- <span id="page-10-4"></span>PRC.Obj.2: A CA private key shall not be compromised.
- <span id="page-10-3"></span>PRC.Obj.3: A CA private key shall be usable during the corresponding certificate validity period respectively the private key usage period specified in the 'Terms and Conditions'.

<span id="page-10-2"></span><sup>2</sup> respectively the main private key of a sub-ca

- <span id="page-11-10"></span>PRC.Obj.4: A CA private key shall not be used and shall therefore be securely deleted after the corresponding certificate validity period respectively the private key usage period specified in the 'Terms and Conditions'. PRC.Obj.5: A CA private key shall be protected from unauthorized access.
- <span id="page-11-9"></span><span id="page-11-8"></span>PRC.Obj.6: A CA private key shall be protected from alteration and deletion during the private key usage period.

#### 5.1.2 Threats

For ['Private key of the CA',](#page-10-1) the following threats need to be considered in a secure CA operation.

- <span id="page-11-7"></span>PRC.Threat.1: A CA key pair is generated without knowledge of the certificate authority's legal body and can therefore be used by an attacker[3](#page-11-0) undetected. The CA is compromised.
- <span id="page-11-6"></span>PRC.Threat.2: The key pair of the CA is eavesdropped during the key generation process. The private key of the CA is compromised.
- <span id="page-11-5"></span>PRC.Threat.3: A CA private key can be compromised by cryptographic analysis if it has been generated with vulnerable algorithms or insufficient key length even without knowledge of the private key.
- <span id="page-11-4"></span>PRC.Threat.4: A CA private key is copied from the key store by an attacker. The private key of the CA is compromised.
- <span id="page-11-3"></span>PRC.Threat.5: The key store is accessible by an attacker and an attacker is able to create electronic signatures pretending they are generated by the CA. The private key of the CA is compromised.
- <span id="page-11-2"></span>PRC.Threat.6: A private key backup is accessible by an attacker. The private key of the CA is compromised.
- <span id="page-11-1"></span>PRC.Threat.7: The key store hardware or software is damaged so that the private key of the CA is unusable.
- <span id="page-11-13"></span>PRC.Threat.8: The CA private key is replaced in the key store by an attacker so that the private key of the CA is unusable and compromised.
- <span id="page-11-12"></span>PRC.Threat.9: The CA private key is deleted in the key store by an attacker or by accident so that the private key of the CA is unusable.
- <span id="page-11-11"></span>PRC.Threat.10: A CA private key is used after the corresponding certificate validity period respectively the private key usage period specified in the 'Terms and Conditions'. This increases the chance for the private key of the CA of being compromised, makes it difficult to verify certificates signed by the CA and weakens the PKI by the CA not fulfilling its own rules.
- PRC.Threat.11: The new CA certificate is not generated before the private key usage of the previous CA certificate has ended. This might enable the usage and distribution of rogue certificates, even a rogue CA certificate, by an attacker due to the following two reasons: 1. the CA is not able to issue certificates or revocation information within that time gap. 2. This threat also precludes the possibility to issue a link-certificate which enable an integrity and authenticity secured dissemination of the new CA certificate.

#### 5.1.3 Requirements

For the '[Private key of the CA](#page-10-1)', the following requirements are necessary in order to fulfill identified objectives and counter identified threats in a secure CA operation.

<span id="page-11-0"></span><sup>3</sup> It shall be considered that the attacker also might be member of the CA personnel.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>5.2 Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions'

Within this document, 'Terms and Conditions' are defined as the collectivity of all documents issued by the CA which define the duties and rights of the PKI members. This will at least include the Certificate Policy and may be expanded by additional documents like e.g. conditions on payment. All documents which shall stay secret due to security reasons are not part of the 'Terms and Conditions'.

Terms and Conditions shall be disseminated to the subscribers to inform them about the organizational and security requirements, which the subscribers have to fulfill before and during participation in the PKI, and which duties can be demanded to be fulfilled by the CA and the other subscribers.

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions'](#page-15-0) process:

*Table 9: Processes on which the ['Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions'](#page-15-0) process depends*

#### 5.2.1 Objectives

For ['Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions',](#page-15-0) the following objectives need to be considered in a secure CA operation.

<span id="page-15-1"></span>DissTC.Obj.1 The CA needs to define limits of certificate usage and the duties of the subscribers and relying parties to make clear in what kind of scope the subscribers are trustworthy. Additionally, the CA needs to declare its liability towards involved parties, i.e. subscribers and relying parties, covering the services the CA offers in key- and certificate management as well as related services (i.e. the validation service) for the PKI. Therefore the CA shall disseminate its current 'Terms and Conditions' to subscribers and relying parties.

#### 5.2.2 Threats

For ['Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions',](#page-15-0) the following threats need to be considered in a secure CA operation. All threats would lead to a situation in which the observance of the rules of the PKI is not ensured for all subscribers, if they are not encountered. In such a situation the trust in the PKI is weakened and the chances for security incidents within the PKI increase.

<span id="page-16-9"></span><span id="page-16-4"></span><span id="page-16-1"></span>

| DissTC.Threat.1 | The 'Terms and Conditions' are disseminated in an incorrect or outdated version (e.g. due<br>to an erroneous version control or a manipulation of the document by an attacker).                                               |

#### <span id="page-16-8"></span>5.2.3 Requirements

For the '[Dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions',](#page-15-0) the following requirements are necessary to fulfill identified objectives and counter identified threats in a secure CA operation.

<span id="page-16-7"></span><span id="page-16-5"></span><span id="page-16-3"></span><span id="page-16-0"></span>

| DissTC.Req.1 | The CA shall make a statement of 'Terms and Conditions' available to subscribers and re<br>lying parties of the PKI the CA operates in. 'Terms and Conditions' shall be made available<br>in a durable way of communication.                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DissTC.Req.2 | In case of relevant changes of the CA structures or processes (e.g. changes in the arrange<br>ment of the CA termination, updates in the CP etc.), the 'Terms and Conditions' shall be<br>updated and provided appropriately to subscribers and relying parties. |
| DissTC.Req.3 | Each new version of the 'Terms and Conditions' shall be identified uniquely (e.g. by a<br>unique version number contained in the text).                                                                                                                          |
| DissTC.Req.4 | The 'Terms and Conditions' acceptance by the subscriber shall be checked during the reg<br>istration process of the subscriber and every time a new version is published.                                                                                        |
| DissTC.Req.5 | The 'Terms and Conditions' shall include regulations for acceptance of updates of the<br>'Terms and Conditions' by subscribers in conformance with applicable laws.                                                                                              |
| DissTC.Req.6 | The dissemination of 'Terms and Conditions' shall be protected from manipulation by<br>[selection: including a checksum, being reachable over https, signature on paper-form [as<br>signment: other methods]].                                                   |

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>5.3 Identification and registration

For a trustworthy environment it is necessary to ensure the correct authentication of subjects in a PKI. This authentication is part of the responsibility of the CA and should precede further processes. Further, it should be specifically done by non-electronic means. This document considers the 'Identification and Registration Service' as one combined service in the process flow.

The 'Identification and Registration Service' involves the contractual agreement between a CA and its subscribers. An applicant shall provide certain documentation for identification to the CA, while the CA checks the identity of this applicant including the name of the applicant.

The ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' process is a recurring process since the data collected during this process always needs to be up-to-date. Even after a successful registration, the subscriber shall provide further ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' data, whenever maintenance or update reasons demand it. In this case, the data might differ from the initial ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' data. At any time however, the ['Identifica](#page-17-0)[tion and registration'](#page-17-0) process shall ensure that the subscriber is unambiguously mapped to her provided data.

| Maintaining                                        | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Maintenance of subscriber keys<br>(cf. sec. 5.4)  | The Identification and registration process comprises IT based and non-<br>-IT based actions to confirm the identification and registration of appli<br>cants to the CA services. It therefore ensures that the received 'Mainte<br>nance of subscriber keys' can be correctly assigned to a subscriber autho<br>rized for certificate application.                                                                |
| 'Certificate generation process'<br>(cf. sec. 5.5) | In order to issue trustable certificates the process of certificate generation<br>shall be applied only for authorized requests. Additionally the informa<br>tion in the newly generated certificate shall be correct and up-to-date<br>concerning the registration data corresponding to the applicant. There<br>fore an appropriate identification and registration process of the sub<br>scribers is necessary. |

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[Identification and registration'](#page-17-0):

*Table 12: Processes maintained by the ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' process*

To ensure that the ['Identification and registration'](#page-17-0) can be processed in a trustworthy manner, the following dependencies shall be fulfilled:

| 'General security requirements'<br>(cf. sec. 6) | Therefore, all processes are based on these fundamental security con<br>cept. The Identification and registration process is based on the 'Gen<br>eral security requirements'. It depends e.g. on well-defined 'Process or<br>ganization', 'Trustworthy personnel', and 'Hardened IT systems and<br>networks supporting logging and monitoring'.<br>A maintained and integrity secured database of subscribers helps in<br>tracing any misused key material, therefore 'Archiving and tracking'<br>forms a basis for the 'Identification and registration' process. |

*Table 13: Processes on which the ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' process depends*

The identified objectives and threats of the '[Identification and registration'](#page-17-0) processes are listed in the following sections. Subsequently, several requirements are defined for the CA. Note, that the process of the ['Identi](#page-17-0)[fication and registration](#page-17-0)' comprises IT-based actions as well as non-IT based actions. A rationale is given below.

#### 5.3.1 Objectives

For the '[Identification and registration'](#page-17-0) process, the following objectives need to be considered for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-18-4"></span><span id="page-18-3"></span>

| IR.Obj.1 | The CA shall ensure that the identity of subscribers can be traced unambiguously, e.g. in a<br>non-IT manner or by using official identity documents. Further, the correctness of rele<br>vant information provided by the subscribers shall be ensured by the CA. |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IR.Obj.2 | Since the CA may offer its certificates for a critical operation (e.g. in identity management<br>or TLS security), it is important for the CA to ensure the accountability of the provided<br>physical identities.                                                 |
| IR.Obj.3 | The CA shall provide a database of the identities (e.g. the name) and attributes of the sub<br>scribers in a secure manner, maintaining the integrity. Based on this database, the certifi<br>cates can be issued unambiguously to the respective subscribers.     |
| IR.Obj.4 | The CA shall be able to distinguish different roles, for example to distinguish between the<br>role of a subscriber and a subject, if they differ.                                                                                                                 |

#### <span id="page-18-2"></span><span id="page-18-1"></span>5.3.2 Threats

For the '[Identification and registration'](#page-17-0) process, the following threats can be identified for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-18-6"></span><span id="page-18-5"></span><span id="page-18-0"></span>

| IR.Threat.1 | A subscriber is registered erroneous: For example, the information yielded during regis<br>tration is incorrect or incorrectly linked. If the identification or registration information<br>is incorrect, an impersonation attack might lead into rogue certificates or issued certifi<br>cates are incorrect an useless. |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IR.Threat.2 | The information, which is transmitted by the subscriber, is eavesdropped during the<br>'Identification and Registration' process. This is a threat due to privacy reasons, and more<br>over the knowledge of registration data facilitates impersonation attacks.                                                         |
| IR.Threat.3 | A subscriber is registered without fulfilling all criteria defined in the 'Terms and Condi<br>tions'. This might lead into security incidents caused by the subscriber and definitely<br>weakens the trustworthiness of the CA as untrustworthy subscribers are stated to be<br>trustworthy.                              |

<span id="page-19-12"></span><span id="page-19-10"></span><span id="page-19-8"></span>

| IR.Threat.4 | The information or status of the registration is manipulated by an attacker during the<br>registration process, which leads to a rogue certificate.                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IR.Threat.5 | The information checked at the registration is outdated. Particularly, the faulty informa<br>tion about the reliability of a subscriber can result in rogue certificates.                                                                                            |
| IR.Threat.6 | Subcontractors or personnel of the CA not adhering the CP claimed by the CA might not<br>uphold a security level 'high'. Thus they may facilitate attack scenarios on the life-cycle<br>part they are involved in.                                                   |
| IR.Threat.7 | If a subscriber is registered several times with different identities and these data sets are<br>not linked, the suspension of a subscriber might be executed incompletely and a sub<br>scriber not fulfilling the requirements of the CA gets certificates wrongly. |
| IR.Threat.8 | The registration information set contains no additional information about the registra<br>tion process. Subscriber information might be outdated, not fully checked or incorrect.                                                                                    |

#### <span id="page-19-7"></span><span id="page-19-6"></span>5.3.3 Requirements

The CA<br>shall define clearly the set of information identifying the applicant. Additional to the<br>name of the applicant at the time point of registration, the [selection: no further informa<br>tion, date of birth, place of birth, national identification documents, [assignment: further in<br>formation]] is/are used for identification. If the subject differs from the subscriber, addi<br>tional information shall be provided and checked. In case of a physical person associated<br>with a legal person, this association shall be verified. |
| IR.Req.8 | The CA shall define the minimum set of information gathered from an applicant which is<br>categorized as attributes, and ensure the sufficient evidence of this information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The signed agreement shall include [selection: agreement of subscribers<br>obligations, confirmation of the correctness of all information provided by the applicant,<br>consent for storing the provided information [assignment: further details]] |
| IR.Req.11 | The CA shall record and archive all relevant information, according to the requirements<br>of section 6.10 ('Archiving and tracking'), to identify the identity of the subscribers such<br>that maintenance and integrity is provided in a secure manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IR.Req.12 | The CA shall check its database to determine if a subscriber has registered before so that<br>multiple identities of a subscriber are linked within the registration database and can be<br>suspended at once or prevented totally if required by the terms and conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IR.Req.13 | The registration information shall contain all relevant information. This shall be [selec<br>tion: type and version of documents send to the subscriber, unique identification number or<br>data of identification documents, signed subscriber agreement, identity of entity registering<br>the subscriber, used verification steps, name of receiving CA and submitting RA if necessary<br>[assignment: further registration information]].                                                                                                              |

*Table 15: Rationale for threats of the ['Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' process*

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>5.4 Maintenance of subscriber keys

As mentioned within the previous section, the Certification Authority shall ensure that a public key is unambiguously identified to belong to the corresponding subscriber. Such a public key will be included in the generated certificate (see Chapter [5.5\)](#page-32-0) and thus bound to the subscriber's identity during the validity period of the certificate. There are the several alternative ways how the subscriber public key and private key can be provided:

• the key pair is generated at the subscriber's area and the public key is provided by the subscriber during the identification process together with the required identity data (see chapter [5.4.1\)](#page-22-0) or

- the Certification Authority generates a key pair on behalf of the subscriber before certificate generation and delivers it to the subscriber in a secure manner (see chapter [5.4.2\)](#page-25-0),
- the Certification Authority provides the key pair and the certificate stored on a personalized token to the subscriber (see chapter [5.4.3\)](#page-28-0).

These alternatives will be described in the following subsections.

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>5.4.1 (optional) Public Key provided by the subscriber

In case the public key is provided by the subscriber there are three possible ways of derivation of the corresponding key pair. The key pair can

- be generated in the subscriber's environment by software applications like SSL servers or email clients
- be generated by a cryptographic module (e.g. smart card, HSM) on the subscriber's choice or
- be derived from a cryptographic module storing prefabricated key pairs which is able to generate signatures and perform decryption of encrypted data.

The CA shall define in it's Terms and Conditions which way(s) of key pair derivation are allowed, which technical requirements have to be fulfilled for key generation, and oblige subscribers to follow the requirements of the Terms and Conditions.

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[\(optional\) Public Key provided by the](#page-22-0)  [subscriber'](#page-22-0):

| Maintaining                                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Dissemination of trustable cer<br>tificates (public keys)'<br>(cf. sec. 5.6) | Only trustable certificates shall be disseminated by the CA which requires<br>that the private keys of the subscribers are generated, used and stored se<br>curely. Also the correct assignment between the public key, the corre<br>sponding private key and the subscriber is of great importance for the<br>dissemination of trustable certificates. |

The second alternative to provide the subscriber's key pair is that the Certification Authority generates the subscriber's key pair and distributes it to the subscriber. Additionally, the CA could offer a subscriber key backup service.

Note, that these methods are in conflict with the requirement that the sole control over subscriber private keys shall be on the subscriber, which is demanded in many PKI use cases.

In PKI use cases where the method is applicable, the objectives and requirements of the present subchapter shall be fulfilled.

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[\(optional\) Subscriber's key pair genera](#page-25-0)[tion and dissemination](#page-25-0)':

#### <span id="page-28-0"></span>5.4.3 (optional) Token management and dissemination

The third method of provision of subscriber keys is to provide "personalized" token storing subscriber key pairs and certificate by the CA and disseminate them to the subscribers.

If token are used for key dissemination the trustworthy management of the token is an essential process to ensure the integrity of the subscriber certificates. The key pair can either be loaded to the token by the CA or is generated by the token itself. If desired, the keys generated by the token can be identified by using a serial number or a token-specific certificate. The secure functioning and correct preparation of the cryptographic hardware prevent the certificates from being compromised.

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[\(optional\) Token management and dis](#page-28-0)[semination'](#page-28-0) process:

*Table 25: Processes on which the ['\(optional\) Token management and dissemination](#page-28-0)' process depends*

#### 5.4.3.1 Objectives

<span id="page-29-5"></span>TM.Obj.1 The token shall be installed and disseminated in a secure manner prevent the token from being compromised.

#### 5.4.3.2 Threats

- <span id="page-29-4"></span>TM.Threat.1: The token is disseminated to the wrong subscriber, meaning subscriber identification and request data and the personalized token are not correlated correctly by the CA.
- <span id="page-29-3"></span>TM.Threat.2: The token is disseminated in a way allowing an attacker to intercept an activated token.
- <span id="page-29-2"></span>TM.Threat.3: The cryptographic hardware of the token is not appropriate to the security requirements of the PKI. An attacker could use a vulnerability of the token to compromise certificates.
- <span id="page-29-1"></span>TM.Threat.4: A subscriber private key can be compromised by cryptographic analysis if it has been generated with vulnerable algorithms or insufficient key length (even without knowledge of the private key).
- <span id="page-29-0"></span>TM.Threat.5: The preparation of the token can be compromised by an attacker manipulating a token which can be misused to compromise the certificate of a subscriber. Also, a faulty preparation of the token can lead to a leakage of protected information (e.g. the private key).
- <span id="page-30-5"></span>TM.Threat.6: The public key is not assigned correctly to the token and a certificate is therefore issued corresponding to a private key of an attacker.
- <span id="page-30-2"></span>TM.Threat.7: The subscribers key pair is not generated within the token and the private key is eavesdropped by an attacker.

#### 5.4.3.3 Requirements

- <span id="page-30-7"></span>TM.Req.1: The CA shall define the cryptographic characteristics of the subscriber keys following ['Appropriate cryptographic measures'](#page-55-0) (cf. sec. [6.5\)](#page-55-0)in the Certificate Policy (cf. sec. [6.2\)](#page-49-0).
- <span id="page-30-8"></span>TM.Req.2: The CA shall ensure that the cryptographic hardware used as a token is appropriate to the security requirements of the certificates throughout its life-cycle and as defined in the-Certificate Policy (cf. sec. [6.2\)](#page-49-0).
- <span id="page-30-12"></span>TM.Req.3: The IT systems and networks of the CA have to fulfill all requirements made in [Hardened](#page-63-0) [IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring](#page-63-0) (cf. sec. [6.9\)](#page-63-0) to ensure that the token is prepared in a secured IT infrastructure.
- <span id="page-30-6"></span>TM.Req.4: The key pair is [selection: *generated and loaded to the token by the CA, generated by the token itself*]. It is strongly recommended that the key pair is generated by the token to prevent the private key from being compromised outside the token.
- <span id="page-30-1"></span>TM.Req.5: In case the key pair is generated and loaded to the token by the CA, the CA shall ensure that the private key generated is handled correctly as long as in premise of the CA, concerning liability of the CA for its operation in key- and certificate life-cycle. Therefore the CA shall ensure that access or manipulation of subscriber private keys is not possible before, during and after the dissemination process following the requirements of chapter[s](#page-56-0) [6.6](#page-56-0) ('[Secured handling and storage of key material\)](#page-56-0) and [6.9](#page-63-0) (['Hardened IT systems and](#page-63-0)  [networks supporting logging and monitoring\)](#page-63-0).

*Table 27: Rationale for threats of the ['\(optional\) Token management and dissemination](#page-28-0)' process*

### <span id="page-32-0"></span>5.5 Certificate generation process

Within the certificate generation process certificates are generated by signing the public key and additional information of the subscriber with the private key of the CA. This does rely on the preceding generation of key-material (cf. Section [5.4\)](#page-21-0) and of course the generation and secure handling of the CA's private key.

By signing the certificates with its private key the CA provides trust in the certificates of subscribers since it confirms that those have been unambiguously identified during the '[Identification and registration](#page-17-0)' (cf. Section [5.3\)](#page-17-0) process, that they are in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate and that they have accepted the disseminated 'Terms and Conditions' (cf. Section [5.2\)](#page-15-0). The CA's corresponding public key is used by the relying parties to verify the signature (cf. Section [4.1\)](#page-9-2).

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[Certificate generation process'](#page-32-0):

| Maintaining                                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Dissemination of trustable certifi<br>cates (public keys)'<br>(cf. sec. 5.6) | A secure 'Certificate generation process' is needed for the dissemina<br>tion of trustable certificates.                |
| 'Trustworthy CA certificate'<br>(cf. sec. 4.1)                                | The CA certificate generation shall meet at least all security require<br>ments defined for the certificate generation. |

*Table 28:Processes maintained by the ['Certificate generation process'](#page-32-0) process*

To ensure that the ['Certificate generation process'](#page-32-0) can be processed in a trustworthy manner, the following dependencies shall be fulfilled:

| Depending on                                                  | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Private key of the CA' (cf. sec. 5.1)                        | Since subscriber certificates are signed with the private key of the CA<br>certificate, the confidentiality and integrity of this private key is neces<br>sary for the security of the issued certificates.                                                                                                                                               |

Additionally, it shall be checked whether the sub<br>scriber is suspended or not.                             |
| 'Certificate renewal, re-keying and<br>update' (cf. sec. 5.8) | For the certificate generation process it is necessary to decide if a cer<br>tificate shall be based on a newly generated key pair and if the sub<br>scriber information contained in the certificate may/shall be changed.<br>The requirements for certificate renewal, re-keying and update define<br>the basis for these decisions.                    |
| 'General security requirements'<br>(cf. sec. 6)               | The Certificate generation process is based on the 'General security re<br>quirements' in detail for example on 'Appropriate cryptographic mea<br>sures', 'Archiving and tracking', 'Secured handling and storage of key<br>material' and 'Hardened IT systems and networks supporting logging<br>and monitoring' that handles the certificates securely. |

|              | The security of issued certificates depends on the measures taken by<br>the CA to secure the key- and certificate-management life-cycle related<br>processes (i.e. by physical, logical and procedural aspects and by means<br>of operations management). |

*Table 29: Processes on which the ['Certificate generation process](#page-32-0)' depends*

Specifically for the key handling during the 'Certificate generation' the following is of concern.

#### 5.5.1 Objectives

- <span id="page-33-10"></span>CG.Obj.1 The CA needs to ensure correct and secure generation of certificates. The certificate generation is the most critical part of the certification life-cycle and concerns the trust the CA provides. Therefore a successful attack on the applied key material or a misuse of such material shall be prevented.
- <span id="page-33-9"></span>CG.Obj.2 The CA shall ensure that the cryptographic measures, which are applied during the process of certificate generation, are state-of-the-art and based on well-known standards.
- <span id="page-33-7"></span>CG.Obj.3 The certificate shall only be created if the subscriber has requested it. Furthermore, the CA shall ensure that the subscriber is entitled to request this certificate and the request is correct.

#### 5.5.2 Threats

- <span id="page-33-6"></span>CG.Threat.1 Utilization of weak cryptographic algorithms might facilitate a compromise of the certificates, allowing forged signatures.
- <span id="page-33-5"></span>CG.Threat.2 The strength of the cryptographic algorithms used for certificate generation get weakened (which will happen over time) because the validity period of the certificate is not limited or chosen too long.
- <span id="page-33-4"></span>CG.Threat.3 The chance to compromise the certificate's key pair is increased because the validity period of the certificate is not limited.
- <span id="page-33-3"></span>CG.Threat.4 The attacker manipulates the information encoded in the certificate during or before the certificate generation process.
- <span id="page-33-2"></span>CG.Threat.5 The information encoded in the certificate has not been checked to be correct according to the registration data of the subscriber before the certificate is generated.
- <span id="page-33-0"></span>CG.Threat.6 The limitations for the usage of the certificate and the corresponding private key are not encoded correctly within the certificate. Then an attacker might use the certificate for purposes he/she is not allowed to according to the Terms and Conditions.

#### 5.5.3 Requirements

- <span id="page-33-1"></span>CG.Req.1 The CA shall ensure, that the requesting subscriber is authorized to request the certificate, before starting the certificate generation process. Therefore the CA shall check the status of the following information: 1.) if the previous certificate of the subscriber has been revoked (cf. sec. [5.7\)](#page-39-0) 2.) if 'Terms and Conditions' have been changed and was disseminated to the subscriber appropriately (cf. sec [5.6\)](#page-35-0) 4.) if attributes (e.g. the name) of the subscriber [assignment: *list of certified attributes of the subscriber*] have changed 5.) if the subscriber has been suspended or not.
- <span id="page-33-8"></span>CG.Req.2 The CA shall not issue a certificate to a suspended subscriber.

<span id="page-34-7"></span><span id="page-34-5"></span><span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-1"></span>

| CG.Req.3  | The CA shall ensure, that the requesting subscriber is identified unambiguously , before<br>starting the certificate generation process. Therefore the CA shall check the following in<br>formation, which shall be included in the certificate: 1.) identification of the CA, 2.) name<br>of the subscriber or the identifiable subject, 3.) specific attribute for the signatory if rele<br>vant, 4.) public key corresponding to the private key under the subscriber control, 5.) pe<br>riod of validity, 6.) the certificate serial number, 7.) the electronic signature of the issuing<br>authority, 8.) limitation of the scope of the certificate, 9.) limitations on transactions, 10.)<br>information about the cryptographic algorithms of the issuing authority's signature and<br>of the public key of the subscriber. |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CG.Req.4  | The CA shall determine the validity period to be applied to a certificate. If a differentia<br>tion between private key usage and validity period of the public key is possible, which de<br>pends on the business case, the CA shall use this opportunity. The CA shall consider the<br>following issues for each different validity/usage period: 1.) need of business case (mini<br>mum period), 2.) legal requirements, 3.) security measures required for the keys (token or<br>software storage), 3.) risk of getting compromised, 4.) amount of damage in case of com<br>promise, 5.) strength of algorithm and key length used, 5.) date until the algorithm/key<br>length is recommended to be secure.                                                                                                                     |

| Depending on                                       | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Certificate generation process'<br>(cf. sec. 5.5) | As long as the CA has not generated a trustable certificate in the 'Cer<br>tificate generation process', the certificate cannot be disseminated. Cer<br>tificates can only be trustable if they are generated correctly.                                                                                                                                         |
| 'Maintenance of subscriber keys'<br>(cf. sec. 5.4) | Only trustable certificates shall be disseminated by the CA, which re<br>quires that the private keys of the subscribers are generated, used,<br>stored and deleted securely. Also the correct assignment between the<br>public key, the corresponding private key and the subscriber is of great<br>importance for the dissemination of trustable certificates. |
| 'General security requirements'<br>(cf. sec. 6)    | The General security requirements for a CA form the basis for a trust<br>ful PKI. Therefore, all processes are based on these fundamental secu<br>rity concept.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

*Table 33: Processes on which the ['Dissemination of trustable certificates \(public keys\)](#page-35-0) process depends*

#### 5.6.1 Objectives

For the '[Dissemination of trustable certificates \(public keys\)](#page-35-0)', the following objectives need to be considered in a secure CA operation.

<span id="page-36-1"></span>DissCert.Obj.1 The CA shall disseminate trustable certificates to the relying parties and the certificate holder.

<span id="page-36-0"></span>DissCert.Obj.2 A certificate shall unambiguously be disseminated to the requesting subscriber. The mapping of the certificate and requesting subscriber shall be checked before dissemination.

#### 5.6.2 Threats

For the '[Dissemination of trustable certificates \(public keys\)](#page-35-0)', the following threats need to be considered in a secure CA operation.

- <span id="page-36-4"></span>DissCert.Threat.1 Non-trustable certificates are disseminated. This would damage the trustworthiness of the CA and the certificates might be used as rogue certificates by an attacker for crime.
- <span id="page-36-3"></span>DissCert.Threat.2 A certificate is disseminated without knowledge of the subscriber/certificate holder. Therefore the subscriber does not protect the corresponding private key appropriately and/or does not report relevant incidents, as the private key is not considered to be the secret of a certificate.
- <span id="page-36-2"></span>DissCert.Threat.3 The certificates are disseminated without consent of the subscriber (or subject) or the certificates are disseminated to a wrong user (e.g. caused by a fault-prone dissemination procedure).

<span id="page-37-3"></span>DissCert.Threat.4 The dissemination of a rogue or wrongful certificate stays undetected and is used by an attacker for crime.

#### 5.6.3 Requirements

For the '[Dissemination of trustable certificates \(public keys\)](#page-35-0)', the following requirements are necessary in order to fulfill identified objectives and counter identified threats in a secure CA operation.

- <span id="page-37-0"></span>DissCert.Req.1 The CA shall provide the complete and accurate certificate to the subscriber it was generated for. The dissemination process shall be supported by the ['General security require](#page-47-0)[ments](#page-47-0)' (cf. sec. [6\)](#page-47-0).
- <span id="page-37-4"></span>DissCert.Req.2 The CA shall ensure that certificates are only retrieved with consent of an authenticated subscriber. This consent can e.g. be given by accepting the 'Terms and Conditions' by the subscriber.
- <span id="page-37-1"></span>DissCert.Req.3 The CA shall ensure that only trustable certificates are disseminated by fulfilling the requirements of ['Certificate generation process](#page-32-0)' (cf. sec. [5.5\)](#page-32-0) and ['Maintenance of subscriber](#page-21-0)  [keys](#page-21-0)' (cf. sec. [5.4\)](#page-21-0).
- <span id="page-37-2"></span>DissCert.Req.4 The public key fingerprint of a CA certificate generated by ['Appropriate cryptographic](#page-55-0)  [measures](#page-55-0)' (cf. sec. [6.5\)](#page-55-0) shall be disseminated to the relying parties on a different channel than the corresponding CA certificate in order to enable relying parties to validate the CA certificate. By using a trustable CA certificate the relying parties are able to validate the subscriber certificates.
- DissCert.Req.5 The CA shall oblige the subscribers and advises the relying parties within the Certificate Policy (cf. sec. [6,](#page-47-0) ['CP Requirements](#page-49-1)') to validate the CA certificate and the subscriber certificates.

*Table 35: Rationale for the threats of the 'Dissemination of trustable certificates (public keys)'*

# <span id="page-39-0"></span>5.7 Revocation and suspension

An absolute and enduring reliability of issued certificates cannot be ensured by hardening IT-Systems, having secure processes, and having clear requirements for subscribers, i.e. there is no 100% security. In order to counter the hopefully few cases, where a certificate has been issued wrongfully, a private key has been compromised, or a subscriber is no longer trustworthy, it shall be possible to revoke trust in certificates or suspend subscribers. For that purpose, a revocation management process shall be installed and the revocation status of certificates and and the suspension status of subscribers shall be held available.

- suspension of certificates: if a certificate is suspended, it is temporarily not trustable; a suspension will either be turned into a revocation or discarded. In the last case the certificate is again valid and trustable;
- revocation of certificates: revoked certificates are not trustable any more;
- subscriber suspension: a subscriber will be suspended, if he is assumed or known to no longer fulfill his duties within the PKI, e.g. due to a key compromise or certificate misuse. In the case of suspension the subscriber will not get any new certificates and every certificate of the subscriber issued before is revoked or at least suspended;

The suspension status information is used for internal purposes, such as determining the subscriber authorization within the certificate generation process, and external purposes such as providing revocation information for relying parties on single certificates.

| Maintaining                                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Certificate renewal, re-keying and<br>update' (cf. sec. 5.8) | For the decision if a certificate shall be renewed, re-keyed or updated<br>the 'Revocation and suspension' status of a certificate or its owner shall<br>be determined. Trustable certificates can only be disseminated if revo<br>cation or suspension in cases of incidents or compromises are possible.                |
| 'Identification and registration'<br>(cf. sec. 5.3)           | The 'Identification and registration' process shall confirm the sub<br>scriber's identity and trustworthy state prior to certificate generation.<br>The subscribers state of suspension shall be part of his/her registration<br>data, as those data shall be considered within the 'Certificate genera<br>tion process'. |

|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'General security requirements'<br>(cf. sec. 6)   | The receipt and processing of revocation and suspension information<br>need to be provided highly available and securely which makes it part of<br>the General security requirements, especially 'Hardened IT systems and<br>networks supporting logging and monitoring' and 'Availability of services'.                      |
| 'Maintained revocation status'<br>(cf. sec. 6.11) | The information on the revocation and suspension status of certificates<br>and subscribers, respectively, must be maintained and made available for<br>relying parties as well as internal purposes like the 'Certificate generation<br>process', therefore the requirements of 'Maintained revocation status' are<br>needed. |

#### 5.7.1 Objectives

<span id="page-40-9"></span><span id="page-40-2"></span><span id="page-40-1"></span>

| RM.Obj.1: | The Revocation and suspension processes ensure that compromised certificates are re<br>voked in a timely manner close to an authorized request or report of a security incident<br>or other valid reason for revocation/suspension reported by a subscriber or a third party.                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RM.Obj.2: | The Revocation and suspension processes ensure that subscribers which are not longer<br>trustworthy (e.g. due to incidents in their IT systems) are suspended by the CA, that their<br>certificates will be revoked, and they will not receive any certificates as long as the sus<br>pension is active. |
| RM.Obj.3: | The revocation management process shall ensure reliable and timely processing of the<br>authorized revocation or suspension requests including the maintenance of the revoca<br>tion lists and suspension status of a subscriber in the registration data.                                               |
| RM.Obj.4: | The revocation status process shall provide the information to the relying parties based<br>upon certificate revocation lists or a real time service which provides status information<br>on an individual basis.                                                                                        |

#### <span id="page-40-8"></span>5.7.2 Threats

<span id="page-40-6"></span>

| RM.Threat.1: | Despite a correct revocation or suspension request, the revocation/suspension status is |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              | not updated by the revocation and suspension management process due to incorrect re     |
|              | vocation handling or incomplete information on the compromised certificate or untrust   |
|              | worthy subscriber.                                                                      |

- <span id="page-40-5"></span>RM.Threat.2: The revocation and suspension management process does not provide the revocation status information in a timely manner or incomplete status information to the relying parties.
- <span id="page-40-4"></span>RM.Threat.3: The revocation or suspension status is updated with an erroneous revocation of a correct certificate or a still trustworthy subscriber (e.g. due to an unauthorized but processed request of report of a revoke, an authorized request or a report of a revoke with faulty requirements ,or a faulty request or report of a revocation appended by an attacker to a correct request or report).
- <span id="page-40-3"></span>RM.Threat.4: The attacker prevents the publication of the revocation of his certificate by circumventing the new revocation list or status information to be reached by the relying parties, e.g. by providing the old revocation list at the download address.

#### 5.7.3 Requirements

- <span id="page-40-7"></span>RM.Req.1: The CA shall provide a service receiving the revocation or suspension request by subscribers or third parties. This service shall be available [assignment: *from hour to hour / days per week*].
- <span id="page-40-0"></span>RM.Req.2: The CA shall define an appropriate procedure for the revocation and suspension started by an authorized certificate revocation or subscriber suspension. The involved parties and

<span id="page-41-2"></span><span id="page-41-1"></span>

|           | revocation/suspension reasons have to be clearly defined. The CA shall ensure: 1.) the<br>identification of persons/institutions with legitimate claim to apply for revocation of a<br>certificate or suspension of a subscriber: the subscriber/certificate holder, [assignment:<br>list of further persons/institutions], 2.) the identification of reasons for a revocation: private<br>key of certificate compromised, incorrect information on certificate, security incident on<br>the IT systems of the certificate holder/subscriber, subscriber not fulfilling Terms and<br>Conditions of the CA, [assignment: other reasons for revocation], 3.) [assignment: the<br>transmission path and record of the revocation] 4.) [assignment: additional requirements for<br>a successful revocation] 5.) After the revocation of a certificate, it shall not be reinstated 6.)<br>The suspension of a subscriber may only be canceled, if the cause for the suspension has<br>been solved |  |

## <span id="page-42-0"></span>5.8 Certificate renewal, re-keying and update

The processes of renewal, re-keying or update of a certificate can be provided by the CA to subscribers, which have been registered by appropriately fulfilling section [5.3.](#page-17-0)

The **renewal of a certificate** is defined as extending the validity period of a certificate. The public key of the subscriber and the subscriber information of the certificate are not modified. The certificate may be signed with a different private key of the CA than the one used originally.

**Re-keying of a certificate** is defined as issuing a new certificate based on a newly generated subscriber's key pair and a new validity period. The remaining content of the certificate (i.e. the attributes of the subscriber) stays usually unchanged.

The **update of a certificate** is defined as issuing a new certificate with updated attributes of the subscriber and a newly generated key pair.

The following table lists the processes which are maintained by the '[Certificate renewal, re-keying and up](#page-42-0)[date'](#page-42-0) process:

| 'Certificate generation process'<br>(cf. sec. 5.5) | Since the period of validity is limited, the certificates have to be renewed<br>periodically. Therefore the concept of a limited period of validity is based<br>on re-keying, updates and renewal of certificates. |

| 'Revocation and suspension'<br>(cf. sec. 5.7)   | The 'Certificate renewal, re-keying and update' process depends on the<br>'Revocation and suspension' process as the decision if the re-keying, up<br>date or renewal of a certificate is allowed, depends on the revocation sta<br>tus of the certificate and the suspension status of the requesting sub<br>scriber.                                                                                                                        |
| 'General security requirements'<br>(cf. sec. 6) | The Certificate renewal, re-keying and update is based on the 'General se<br>curity requirements' for example on 'Maintained revocation status' and<br>'Hardened IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring'.<br>The IT infrastructure (i.e. networks, servers and databases) have to be thor<br>oughly secured to prevent unnoticed intrusion and misuse of the mecha<br>nisms for certificate renewal, re-keying and update. |

#### 5.8.1 Objectives

<span id="page-43-4"></span>Renew.Obj.1: The CA shall provide an appropriate process for renewal, re-keying and/or update of a certificate if the process is requested by the subscriber or started by the CA. The CA shall ensure that the request is processed in a timely manner.

#### 5.8.2 Threats

- <span id="page-43-3"></span>Renew.Threat.1: The security of a certificate is compromised, if it is renewed, re-keyed or updated without checking before whether the certificate has been revoked or the subscriber has been suspended.
- <span id="page-43-2"></span>Renew.Threat.2: A renewal of a certificate is processed and the validity period of the key pair is extended, though an appropriate strength of the used cryptographic algorithm and key length is not ensured for the whole validity period of the key-pair. Additionally, the chance to compromise the private key by a brute-force attack increases with the validity period.
- <span id="page-43-1"></span>Renew.Threat.3: A renewal of a certificate is processed and despite of the algorithm used for the key-pair of the certificate has been broken or the key lengths are too short concerning actual cryptographic and technical tools. An attacker can easily compromise the private key.
- <span id="page-43-0"></span>Renew.Threat.4: The re-keying or the update of a certificate is processed by using the old key pair, this facilitates brute force attacks, and might lead to the use of weak cryptography for the certificate.
- <span id="page-44-4"></span>Renew.Threat.5: The re-keying or the update of a certificate is processed by using the same key lengths and cryptographic algorithms for the new key-pair as for the old one. This might lead to the use of weak cryptography for the certificate.
- <span id="page-44-2"></span>Renew.Threat.6: The re-keying or renewal of a certificate is done, although the subscriber's registration data have changed. This leads to an incorrect certificate which might be used as an rogue certificate.
- <span id="page-44-0"></span>Renew.Threat.7: The re-keying, renewal or update of the trustworthy CA certificate is processed and an attacker succeeds to disseminate an own rogue certificate as new CA certificate. In this situation the whole PKI is compromised.
- <span id="page-44-11"></span>Renew.Threat.8: The re-keying, renewal or update of the trustworthy CA certificate is not finished before the validity period of the old CA certificate has expired. In such a situation the trust anchor of the PKI is not existing for that time gap. Certificates can not be revoked – which is the most critical problem in this case –, signatures can not be checked correctly and subscriber certificate can not be issued. Additionally, generating a cryptographic link between old and new CA certificate, which could be a countermeasure for Renew.Threat[.7,](#page-44-0) is not possible.
- <span id="page-44-10"></span>Renew.Threat.9: The security of a certificate is weakened if certificates are renewed, re-keyed or updated for a public key without checking that the corresponding certificate has been revoked.

| Renew.Req.4: | The CA shall check carefully, if the renewal of a certificate is appropriate. Therefore the<br>need for a renewal instead of re-keying demanded by the business case shall be balanced<br>with the security risk of the weakened key pair, the validity period of the certificate and<br>the used algorithms.

#### <span id="page-45-2"></span>5.8.4 Rationale

For the '[Certificate renewal, re-keying and update](#page-42-0)', the following rationales hold:

| Objective   | Covered by                                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Renew.Obj.1 | Renew.Req.1<br>Renew.Req.8<br>Renew.Req.4<br>Renew.Req.10 | Renew.Obj.1 requires the CA to provide an appropriate and timely process<br>for renewal, re-keying and/or update of a certificate. Renew.Req.1 and Re<br>new.Req.8 require that the certificate can be renewed, re-keyed or updated<br>in a secure and timely manner. Renew.Req.4 ensures balanced compro<br>mises between renewal and re-keying (or update) of certificates. Re<br>new.Req.10 ensures transparency about the CA's renewal policies for sub<br>scribers and relying parties. |

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>6 General security requirements

A CA provides services in a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) comprising all necessary key and certificate management life-cycle processes. Therefore the CA shall be considered trustworthy by subscribers and relying parties for any of its services.

To ensure trustworthiness for the processes identified in chapter [5,](#page-10-6) various aspects (e.g. operational, infrastructure, physical and personnel related) have to be considered. Each of the following subsections covers such general security requirements. Objectives, threats and requirements are provided focusing on secure operation of a CA at security level 'high'.

The following subsections have inter-dependencies which are left out of the scope of this document. Depending on the viewpoint one subsection might condition the other. Changing the perspective might change the perceived dependencies. As a consequence, all these requirements shall be fulfilled to provide security level 'high' of a CA.

# <span id="page-47-1"></span>6.1 Information Security Management System

A CA shall implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS) according to [ISO 27001].

In [ISO 27001] information security is defined as 'preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; in addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved'. Further, ISMS are defined as 'that part of the overall management system, based on a business risk approach, to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve information security'.

The ISMS maintains all general security requirements by requiring and supporting their design to be well-defined and secure, and demanding the regularly processed review of the implementation.

### 6.1.1 Objectives

For ['Information Security Management System](#page-47-1)', the following objectives are identified for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-47-6"></span>SecMgmt.Obj.1: A CA shall implement and continuously maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS) according to [ISO 27001] with security level 'high'.

<span id="page-47-4"></span>SecMgmt.Obj.2: The ISMS shall cover all aspects necessary for a trustworthy operation of CA services.

### 6.1.2 Threats

For ['Information Security Management System](#page-47-1)', the following threats are identified for secure CA operation. SecMgmt.Threat.1: The ISMS is not maintained continuously, the infrastructure either will not be secured

<span id="page-47-3"></span><span id="page-47-2"></span>against new security risks in a proper form or changes on e.g. software might result in security gaps.

SecMgmt.Threat.2: The ISMS is incomplete concerning the provided CA services, security gaps might stay undetected and will be misused by an attacker.

### 6.1.3 Requirements

The following describes the requirements to Security Management at a CA, specifically considering security level 'high'.

<span id="page-47-5"></span>SecMgmt.Req.1: The CA shall implement system(s) for quality and information security management appropriate for the provided certification services.

<span id="page-48-3"></span><span id="page-48-2"></span><span id="page-48-1"></span>

| SecMgmt.Req.2: | The information security infrastructure necessary to manage security within the CA shall<br>be maintained at all times. Any changes (e.g. on IT systems, hardware, organization, etc.),<br>that will have impact on security level 'high', shall be approved by the security manage<br>ment of the CA. |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SecMgmt.Req.3: | The CA shall check relevant sources [assignment: defined sources for news on security risks]<br>on being applicable for the CA at least [selection:once per day, [assignment: other defined<br>periods]] and shall incorporate them within the ISMS and the CA's operations.                           |
| SecMgmt.Req.4: | The CA shall be certified by an independent external ISO27001 auditor on a regular basis<br>[selection:once per year, [assignment: other defined periods]]. The audit process shall in<br>clude the ISMS and the further requirements of the "Secure CA Operation".                                    |
| SecMgmt.Req.5: | The CA shall provide appropriate measures for the case of an incident particularly con<br>sidering the compromise of the private key of the CA, the compromise of an algorithm or<br>the breakdown of the system.                                                                                      |
| SecMgmt.Req.6: | The CA shall carry out risk assessment [selection:once per year, [assignment: other defined<br>periods]] to evaluate business risk and determine recent security requirements and opera<br>tional procedures. The risk analysis shall be revised if necessary.                                         |
| SecMgmt.Req.7: | The Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement shall be part of the documen<br>tation which is maintained within the ISMS.                                                                                                                                                                |

*Table 48: Rationale for threats of the ['Information Security Management System](#page-47-1)'*

# <span id="page-49-0"></span>6.2 Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement

Concerning the security aspects of the CA operation, the Certificate Policy (CP) is the most important basis to be referenced in the CA's 'Terms and Conditions'.

According to [RFC3647] a Certificate Policy (CP) is a 'named set of rules that indicates applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class application with common security requirements'. The purpose of the certificate policy states "what is to be adhered to".

A Certification Practice Statement (CPS) is issued by a CA and defines the implementation of measures at the CA to accommodate requirements as defined in the Certificate Policy. In this context, a CPS is more refined than the CP it conforms to, considering individual measures to secure key and certificate management lifecycle and their technical realization. A certification practice statement states "how it is adhered to",

#### 6.2.1 Objectives

For ['Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement](#page-49-0)', the following objectives are identified for secure CA operation.

- <span id="page-49-9"></span>CP.Obj.1: The CA shall provide a CP defining the scope of the PKI and the rules for the PKI participants. The CP shall be available to all PKI subscribers and relying parties. The CP constitutes the basis for the CA's 'Terms and Conditions'.
- <span id="page-49-8"></span>CP.Obj.2: The CPS represents the PKI application specific part of the CA security concepts and documents maintained by the CA ISMS. The CPS may be made (partially) available to subscribers or relying parties at the CA's discretion.

#### 6.2.2 Threats

For ['Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement](#page-49-0)', the following threats are identified for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-49-7"></span><span id="page-49-6"></span>

| CP.Threat.1: | The requirements and/or definitions within the CP are incomprehensible, conflicting,<br>outdated, incomplete or not satisfiable, so the security measures to be fulfilled by the sub<br>scribers will not be adhered.                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CP.Threat.2: | The CP can not be clearly identified, so the subscribers are not able to determine, if they<br>consider the correct document (version) and may follow an outdated version so the secu<br>rity measures to be fulfilled by the subscribers might not be adhered. |
| CP.Threat.3: | The requirements and/or definitions within the CP are not appropriate to the security<br>level 'high' of the CA, so the security of the CA will be weakened.                                                                                                    |
| CP.Threat.4: | There is no information how to contact the CA available for subscribers, so the subscriber                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### <span id="page-49-1"></span>6.2.3 CP Requirements

The following requirements shall be fulfilled by the CA to provide an adequate '[Certificate Policy and Certifi](#page-49-0)[cation Practice Statement'](#page-49-0):

<span id="page-49-2"></span>CP.Req.1: The CP shall include a reference to a contact person of the CA.

<span id="page-49-4"></span><span id="page-49-3"></span>is not able to clarify questions on the CP.

<span id="page-49-5"></span>CP.Req.2: The CP shall include a section with document identification of the CP for further reference, i.e. by exact document title, version and unique policy identifier for reference in certificates issued by the CA.

- <span id="page-50-3"></span>CP.Req.3: It is strongly recommended to support the 'certificate policies' extension in X.509 subscriber certificates which identifies the CP via the unique policy identifier (object identifier) and optionally provides a URL pointing to the CP document.
- <span id="page-50-2"></span>CP.Req.4: Each new version of the CP shall be identified uniquely (e.g. by a unique version number contained in the text).
- <span id="page-50-1"></span>CP.Req.5: In case of relevant changes of the CA structures or processes the CP shall be updated and provided appropriately to subscribers and relying parties.
- <span id="page-50-0"></span>CP.Req.6: The CP shall specify the scope and applicability of the PKI as well as the key- and certificate management life-cycle processes of the CA completely, comprehensively and adequate to the security level 'high'. The following aspects shall be covered at a minimum:
	- reference to a document owner and contact person for document management related issues
	- document identification for further reference, i.e. by exact document title, version and unique policy identifier for reference in certificates issued by the CA
	- limitations concerning subscribers of the PKI (e.g. company or administration specific PKIs)
	- application context of the PKI
	- description of subscriber registration procedures including specification of registration data, requirements for data transmission, and description of verification procedures of the RA
	- subscriber obligations (e.g. requirements on subscriber key stores and application environment)
	- specification of certificate profiles
	- validation model of the PKI, need of certificate validation by checking signature and fingerprints
	- certificate enrollment protocols and data formats (if required)
	- certificate status information services (if available)
	- directory services (if available)
	- procedures in case of a key compromise
	- certificate revocation procedures including revocation reasons, revocation authorization, revocation application mechanisms (if available)
	- certificate revocation lists (if available)
	- certificate renewal procedures
	- CA termination
	- CP update procedures

#### 6.2.4 Requirements to a CPS

The following requirements shall be fulfilled by the CA to provide an adequate '[Certificate Policy and Certifi](#page-49-0)[cation Practice Statement'](#page-49-0):

<span id="page-51-4"></span><span id="page-51-3"></span><span id="page-51-2"></span><span id="page-51-1"></span>CP.Req.7: The CPS shall include a reference to a document owner responsible for the document management. CP.Req.8: The CPS shall include a section with document identification of the CPS for further reference, i.e. by exact document title, version and unique policy identifier of the CP which the CPS is corresponding to. CP.Req.9: Each new version of the CPS shall be identified uniquely (e.g. by a unique version number contained in the text). CP.Req.10: The CPS shall reflect all PKI aspects and processes which are specified in the CP. It shall describe on a technical level, how the requirements from the CP are satisfied on security level 'high'. The CPS may reference further security related documents of the CA operation (e. g. emergency management concept, operation organization concept, role allocation concept, etc.) which are maintained within the ISMS. CP.Req.11: In case of any changes in the CP or other (e. g. pure technical) changes in the processes described within, the CPS shall be checked and updated if necessary.

# <span id="page-52-0"></span>6.3 Emergency management and incident handling

This section covers the service responsible for incidents, such as state of emergency or compromise of the CA. Therefore requirements for business continuity and incident handling are the focus of this section.

#### 6.3.1 Objectives

For ['Emergency management and incident handling](#page-52-0)', the following objectives can be identified for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-52-12"></span><span id="page-52-11"></span>

| IM.Obj.1 | The CA needs to ensure timely, appropriate reaction to incidents to limit the damage to<br>its business operation, while ensuring continuous liability and obligation towards sub<br>scribers. |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IM.Obj.2 | After a severe incident, the CA shall ensure a timely restart of the services for the case<br>that the CA systems data needed to be recovered from the back up.                                |
| IM.Obj.3 | The CA shall prepare and realize an appropriate reaction if security relevant algorithms<br>or processes are broken/insecure.                                                                  |

### <span id="page-52-9"></span>6.3.2 Threats

For ['Emergency management and incident handling](#page-52-0)' process, the following requirements can be identified to fulfill objectives and counter the threats identified for a secure CA operation.

<span id="page-52-6"></span>IM.Threat.1 A compromised key is still used after a serious compromise. Particularly, if the private key of the certificate of the CA is compromised, the damage can be maximal.

- <span id="page-52-5"></span>IM.Threat.2 A security incident might be not appropriately countered and the attacker might subsequently obtain access to additional and more critical systems. Specifically, if the reporting is not sufficiently and timely towards responsible roles, in case of misuse of the CA servers and software, the attacker might continue to produce rogue certificates in the meantime.
- <span id="page-52-3"></span>IM.Threat.3 An emergency (e.g. fire, flood) or incident (e.g. compromise of private key) occurs that makes data, CA keys and working aids (Hard- and Software) unusable.

#### 6.3.3 Requirements

- <span id="page-52-8"></span><span id="page-52-7"></span><span id="page-52-4"></span>IM.Req.1: The CA needs to ensure timely, appropriate reaction to incidents to limit the damage to its business operation ensuring continuous liability and obligation towards subscribers. IM.Req.2: The CA shall prepare and realize an appropriate reaction if security relevant algorithms or processes are broken/ insecure, including a migration plan, using key generation hardand software prepared for further algorithms. IM.Req.3: If key material is susceptible or suspected to be compromised, the CA shall not continue to utilize that key material. IM.Req.4: The CA shall prepare an appropriate reaction to minimize risk and damage, by [assignment: *list of reactions*]. IM.Req.5: The CA shall prepare appropriate measures to determine reasons for emergencies or incidents and to prevent them in future cases, by [assignment: *list of measures*].
- <span id="page-52-10"></span><span id="page-52-2"></span><span id="page-52-1"></span>IM.Req.6: The CA shall prepare emergency plans to reactivate itself after emergency or incident handling, considering the following processes [assignment: *list of processes*].
- <span id="page-53-1"></span>IM.Req.7: The CA shall have backups of data, its keys and working aids (hard- and software), including registration information, issued certificates, revocation information, [assignment: *list of data and hard-/software*].
- <span id="page-53-0"></span>IM.Req.8: After a severe incident, the CA shall first of all ensure that the security vulnerability, which caused the incident being harmful, is closed. Then a timely restart of the services for the case that the CA systems data needed to be recovered from the back up shall be processed.

# <span id="page-54-0"></span>6.4 Process organization

The CA operations need several processes which are done (partly) manual, e.g. checking the subscriber's information during the registration process. For a secure CA operation these manual processes shall also be well-defined and secured.

#### 6.4.1 Objectives

<span id="page-54-7"></span>

| PrO.Obj.1: | Each (manual) process is unambiguously well defined and robust with respect to misin |  |  |  |  |

#### <span id="page-54-3"></span>PrO.Obj.2: Each (manual) process is sufficiently secured in order to prevent escaping from its scope.

#### 6.4.2 Threats

<span id="page-54-9"></span>PrO.Threat.1: Circumvention of processes is possible unintentionally by misinterpretation.

<span id="page-54-8"></span>PrO.Threat.2: Without a well-defined process organization, security gaps within the processes might stay unseen, adoption and separation of roles is not possible and tasks are unclear. Each of this weakens the security of the CA.

#### 6.4.3 Requirements

The CA shall ensure restricted several risk related operational measures, i.e. the following:

- <span id="page-54-6"></span>PrO.Req.1: Every (partly) manual process within CA operations shall be explicitly defined for every single task, interfaces to IT processes shall be determined and the necessary roles shall be stated.
- <span id="page-54-2"></span>PrO.Req.2: The CA needs to implement audit trail with the intend to identify evidence of malicious activity. There shall be responsible roles [assignment: *responsible roles*] monitoring and reviewing these audit logs regularly [assignment: *number of days, weeks or months*].
- <span id="page-54-5"></span>PrO.Req.3: The CA security operations relating to the process for the certificate-management as described in chapter [5](#page-10-6) shall be separated from all other business related activity of the CA.
- <span id="page-54-1"></span>PrO.Req.4: The CA needs to ensure that any security breach is responded by an appropriate countermeasure to limit the impact of any in a timely and co-ordinated manner. Responsible roles shall be enabled to act quickly on the respective issue.
- <span id="page-54-4"></span>PrO.Req.5: The process organization shall provide a contingency plan for the PKI in case of the termination of the CA. Particularly the CA shall provide agreements with successor instances prior to it's termination.

### <span id="page-58-0"></span>6.7 Role-management

#### 6.7.1 Objectives

<span id="page-58-3"></span>Role.Obj.1: The CA operation shall rely on a robust organization supporting the critical processes in a secure CA operational environment.

- <span id="page-58-2"></span>Role.Obj.2: The responsibilities for all relevant aspects in the CA process-flows shall be conducted by individuals according to the statement of the CA considering its secure operation.
- <span id="page-58-1"></span>Role.Obj.3: According to the aspects supported by different roles, the individuals shall consider the respective obligations in their roles.

#### 6.7.2 Threats

- <span id="page-58-7"></span>Role.Threat.1: If roles are not defined properly to distribute responsibilities with respect to different roles with a substitution procedure, there might be situations that are critical to the process-flow which depend on availability of a single individual.
- <span id="page-58-6"></span>Role.Threat.2: If the boundaries for the tasks in the certificate-management life-cycle are not effectively clarified and the tasks, comprising incidents, are not associated with individual roles considering a daily operation, this could evolve into situations where the responsibilities are questionable for the involved persons and do effectively weaken the CA's flexibility to react in case of incidents or emergency.
- <span id="page-58-5"></span>Role.Threat.3: If there is no escalation procedure for cases not covered by the standard procedures of a role, incidents may not be countered effectively or critical tasks of the CA are not fulfilled.
- <span id="page-58-4"></span>Role.Threat.4: If access to assets critical to the certificate-management life-cycle is handled by only a single individual, then this individual might be exposed to bribery attempts or other forms of threat resulting in disproportionate danger for the individual and possible violation of critical assets in the secure CA operation.

#### 6.7.3 Requirements

The roles of the CA shall fulfill the following requirements.

- <span id="page-59-6"></span>Role.Req.1: The CA operation shall rely on a robust organization supporting the critical processes in a secure CA operational environment.
- <span id="page-59-4"></span>Role.Req.2: The responsibilities for all relevant aspects in the CA process-flows shall be conducted by individuals according to the statement of the CA considering its secure operation.
- <span id="page-59-2"></span>Role.Req.3: According to the aspects supported by different roles, the individuals shall consider the respective obligations in their roles.
- <span id="page-59-0"></span>Role.Req.4: For each defined role there shall be at least one substitute to limit negative effects on the process-flow conducted at the CA if an individual might be unavailable to fulfill his or her role. There shall also be escalation procedures for any occurring incident to formalize reporting towards the management of departments. This needs to be balanced with Role.Req[.10.](#page-59-1)
- <span id="page-59-9"></span>Role.Req.5: For the responsibilities of the individuals conducting the roles at the CA, the boundaries to each of these responsibilities shall be well-defined in a matter enabling to provide clear structure in personnel organization at the CA and RA conducting its services.
- <span id="page-59-8"></span>Role.Req.6: For any role in the certificate-management life-cycle non-disclosure agreements shall obligate the individuals to handle the assets involved with care.
- <span id="page-59-7"></span>Role.Req.7: Critical access to assets shall require four-eyes principle to distribute the responsibilities towards two responsible personnel for the respective asset.
- <span id="page-59-5"></span>Role.Req.8: As basis for a role management considering a CA operation, at least the following roles shall be considered necessary:

| Roles                | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| RA Operator          | management of registration data including suspension and revoca<br>tion information,                                                                                                                                    |
| IT Security Officer  | planning and monitoring the implementation of security measures<br>concerning the whole CA operations, including technical, organiza<br>tional and physical measures                                                    |
| System Administrator | configuration and maintenance of the IT structure, including net<br>works, databases and server                                                                                                                         |
| Access Manager       | adopting roles, access rights (technical and organizational) and per<br>sons                                                                                                                                            |
| Revisor              | internal auditor, checking log-data, databases and paper-based doc<br>umentation of the CA business regularly, which means every [as<br>signment: number of days or months to maximum of 6 months] on<br>inconstancies. |

#### <span id="page-59-3"></span>Role.Req.9: The CA/RA shall identify roles that have particular importance for the processes in the certificate-management process-flow in its Certificate Policy towards the relying parties.

<span id="page-59-1"></span>Role.Req.10: The number of personnel authorized to carry out security relevant or critical functions shall be minimized. This needs to be balanced with Role.Req[.4.](#page-59-0)

<span id="page-60-2"></span>Role.Req.11: The set of roles defined for actions conducted by the CA shall be separated from the set of roles defined for actions conducted by the RA. The separation shall ensure, that the persons who are responsible for maintaining registration information of applicants registered do not additionally handle the certificate generation process vice versa.

<span id="page-60-1"></span>Role.Req.12: The CA shall strictly follow the principle of separation of roles for the following combinations ('X' means roles shall not be fulfilled by the same individual):

|                          | RA oper<br>ator | CA oper<br>ator | System admin<br>istrator | Access<br>manager | Revisor |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| RA operator              |                 | X               | X                        | X                 | X       |
| CA operator              | X               |                 | X                        | X                 | X       |
| System admin<br>istrator | X               | X               |                          | X                 | X       |
| Access manager X         |                 | X               | X                        |                   | X       |
| Revisor                  | X               | X               | X                        | X                 |         |

That is, the roles of RA operator, CA operator, System administrator, access manager and revisor shall be separated and any two of the roles shall not fulfilled by the same individual.

<span id="page-60-0"></span>Role.Req.13: The CA/RA shall identify roles that have particular importance for the processes in the certificate-management process-flow in its Term and Conditions towards the relying parties.

<span id="page-60-3"></span>Role.Req.14: There shall be a well defined and unambiguous escalation management.

# <span id="page-63-0"></span>6.9 Hardened IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring

If the IT systems (e.g. specifically the servers) used for critical stages in the key and certificate life-cycle management are not secured, an intrusion by hackers might be successful resulting in compromise of the signing process, manipulation of revocation lists and in worst case undetected rogue certificates. If an attacker succeeds to manipulate the log files, then such an attack might not be traceable at all. This would result in lost of trust into any service provided by the CA. The CA is liable to ensure the necessary measures for the services under its premises including the subcontractors.

#### 6.9.1 Objectives

- <span id="page-63-10"></span>IT.Obj.1: The IT systems and networks shall be hardened against attacks. This includes logging of the IT systems and monitoring by an intrusion-detection-system .
- <span id="page-63-8"></span>IT.Obj.2: The IT systems shall be separated for levels with lower and higher security demands (e.g. by properly defined firewalls). Particularly, the CA server should be separated from other parts of the IT network.
- <span id="page-63-7"></span>IT.Obj.3: The functionality of all system components shall be tailored (i.e. restricted) exactly to the demands for the CA operation and be highly secured against viruses and other unauthorized software.

#### 6.9.2 Threats

<span id="page-63-6"></span><span id="page-63-5"></span><span id="page-63-3"></span>IT.Threat.1: If the logging of the IT system by an intrusion-detection-system is not implemented properly, an attacker could succeed manipulating the log files. Therefore, an attack could not be traceable. IT.Threat.2: If the log files is not reviewed regularly, a manipulation by an attacker might not be detected. IT.Threat.3: If the security measures for the IT system (e.g. software of the CA server) is not reviewed regularly, an attacker might use recent and public vulnerabilities of software components for a manipulation. IT.Threat.4: If the user and account management not implemented properly, an attacker could use faulty defined accounts with a low security level to access to highly sensitive areas. IT.Threat.5: If the security measures, server and network configuration is not written down properly, security gaps might stay unseen or necessary configuration changes cannot be implemented.

#### <span id="page-63-2"></span><span id="page-63-1"></span>6.9.3 Requirements

The CA shall ensure that the IT systems and servers used for the processes and databases of the CA are hardened by several means, i.e. the following requirements for system-access management.

- <span id="page-63-4"></span>IT.Req.1: The CA shall implement controls (e.g. firewall) to protect and separate the CA internal network domains from unauthorized access.
- <span id="page-63-9"></span>IT.Req.2: The Implementation of an intrusion-detection-system (IDS) covering the secure network segment shall be considered. If an IDS is used, the log files recorded by the IDS shall be monitored for each incident but a least in a period of [assignment: *number of days, weeks or months*].

<span id="page-64-12"></span><span id="page-64-11"></span><span id="page-64-10"></span><span id="page-64-9"></span><span id="page-64-8"></span><span id="page-64-7"></span><span id="page-64-6"></span><span id="page-64-5"></span><span id="page-64-4"></span><span id="page-64-3"></span><span id="page-64-2"></span><span id="page-64-1"></span><span id="page-64-0"></span>

| IT.Req.3:  | The secure network of the CA shall be regularly, in a period of [assignment: number of<br>days, weeks or months], reviewed concerning settings and configuration options. Also<br>penetration testing shall be conducted regularly, in a period of [assignment: number of<br>days, weeks or months].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| IT.Req.6:  | The CA servers should only provide a limited set of services as needed for their proposed<br>operation. Specifically unintended installations of unnecessary proxy or web server func<br>tionality shall be avoided. Installation of such should be prohibited if not regarded as<br>necessary for the operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IT.Req.7:  | The network, in which the CA servers are located, shall be secured with respect to net<br>work separation.

This<br>shall also cover the audit trail (cf. sec. Archiving and tracking). The log files for the audit<br>have to be stored on a server different from the system under audit. The log file storage<br>should [selection: not allow deletion of log files; only allow automated deletion of log files<br>after [assignment: number of days]; allow deletion of log files only by [assignment: list of<br>roles]]. |
| IT.Req.10: | Log files and audit trail, namely [assignment: list of log files or trails], shall be reviewed<br>regularly, in a period of [assignment: number of days, weeks or months], and automated<br>measures shall trigger notifications when a deviation from intended operation is deter<br>mined. The audit trail shall not be stored on the server the audit is conducted for. The<br>storage size of the log files and audit trails shall be tailored appropriately.                                                                                                                               |
| IT.Req.11: | The log files and audit trail should not be stored on the CA servers used for the manage<br>ment of the certificates only. They should be exported via a secured connection on<br>servers dedicated for storage of log files. The database for the audit trail shall be append<br>only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

# <span id="page-65-0"></span>6.10 Archiving and tracking

Archiving and tracking of certificates and registration data shall be implemented by a CA to provide the possibility of controlling or recovering disseminated certificates and registration data. Therefore a well-defined set of necessary information shall be defined by the CA.

#### 6.10.1 Objectives

<span id="page-65-1"></span>ArchC.Obj.1: The CA shall implement the archiving and tracking of disseminated certificates and registration data. The set of information, which shall be archived and tracked, shall be clearly defined, unambiguously mappable to certificates, registration information and subscriber. Further, the set of information shall contain all relevant information.

#### 6.10.2 Threats

- <span id="page-66-2"></span>ArchC.Threat.1: If certificates shall be recovered from the archiving or tracking files, the mapping to the subscribers or the archived information can be fragmentary. For this case, the certificates cannot be renewed, re-keyed or updated.
- ArchC.Threat.2: If the archived or tracked data was manipulated, a rogue certificate could be disseminated during a renewal, re-keying or updating process.

#### 6.10.3 Requirements

The following requirements shall be fulfilled by the CA to provide a trustworthy basis for [Archiving and](#page-65-0)  [tracking:](#page-65-0)

<span id="page-66-8"></span><span id="page-66-7"></span><span id="page-66-6"></span><span id="page-66-5"></span><span id="page-66-1"></span>

| ArchC.Req.1  | The CA shall ensure that a complete set of information concerning a certificate is<br>archived. This set shall be clearly and a priori defined, containing the information rele<br>vant for the certificate and be stored for an appropriate time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ArchC.Req.2: | The CA shall be able to associate unambiguously all disseminated certificates to the regis<br>tered applicant the respective certificate has been disseminated to as a subject.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ArchC.Req.3: | Using an appropriate archiving of clearly defined data of the disseminated certificates,<br>the availability of services by the complete recovering shall be ensured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ArchC.Req.4: | The databases shall be maintained with up-to-date consistency between the database rel<br>evant for the certificate dissemination (CA) and the database used for the registered ap<br>plicants (RA specific). The integrity and confidentiality of the databases shall be ensured<br>by the measures provided by 'Physical and environmental security' (cf. sec. 6.12) and<br>'Hardened IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring' (cf. sec. 6.9).                                                                              |
| ArchC.Req.5: | The set of information, which is archived with respect to the tracking and recovering of<br>disseminated certificates, shall be clearly defined and unambiguously be referred to a cer<br>tificate. The appropriate back-up in terms of IT-services is covered by the section 'Hard<br>ened IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring'.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ArchC.Req.6: | The set of information shall contain [selection: registration information, essential CA<br>events (e.g. certificate generation), key management and certification events, [assignment:<br>further information]]. For each event, the time point shall be recorded precisely. The pe<br>riod of time for keeping the archived information shall be defined and stored for [selec<br>tion: each distinct certificate, for distinct classes of certificates or for all certificates] as indi<br>cated in the 'Terms and Conditions'.               |
| ArchC.Req.7: | The essential CA events, which are archived, shall be clearly defined: [selection: certificate<br>generation relating to the life-cycle of the CA key or the certificates, re-keying, renewal and<br>update of certificates, emergency management or incident handling if relevant for the cer<br>tificate [assignment: further CA events]].                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ArchC.Req.8: | If data relevant for disseminated certificate shall be recovered, the archived set of infor<br>mation, the mapping onto certificates and to the registered subscribers shall be sufficient<br>for certificate renewal, re-keying or update processes. The archiving and tracking shall<br>ensure that no rogue or manipulated certificate are disseminated. The proper implemen<br>tation of the data storage shall be ensured by the requirements following the section<br>Hardened IT systems and networks supporting logging and monitoring. |

# <span id="page-67-0"></span>6.11 Maintained revocation status

A core requirement for the CA instantiating as anchor of confidence in the PKI is, that the revocation information are up-to-date and in order, so that relying parties can check if the certificate to a signature in validation is revoked or still valid. Therefore the CA shall provide the technical infrastructure to provide such service for the relying parties in the PKI to use the service.

#### 6.11.1 Objectives

<span id="page-67-4"></span>MRS.Obj.1: The CA shall ensure that revocation information are accessible to the relying parties and up-to-date. The technical infrastructure provided by the CA shall be tailored for the estimated traffic.

#### 6.11.2 Threats

- <span id="page-67-3"></span>MRS.Threat.1: If the maintained revocation information are not secured against data loss and hardened against manipulation, an attacker could remove compromised certificates from the revocation information.
- <span id="page-67-1"></span>MRS.Threat.2: If the servers are not hardened against failure or not appropriately tailored for the traffic, the revocation information are not accessible. During the period of the non-accessibility, relying parties could falsely rely on a revoked certificate.
- MRS.Threat.3 If the servers are not hardened against manipulation, an attacker can replace revocation information with outdated information.

#### 6.11.3 Requirements

<span id="page-67-2"></span>MRS.Req.1: The CA shall ensure that the maintained revocation information is secured against data lost, hardened against manipulation and updated in a period of [assignment: *number of hours*] hours in case of a revocation.

Application Note 2: The maintained revocation lists need to be backed up to a physically separated server to avoid the loss of sensitive data (cf. sec. [6.9\)](#page-63-0). To ensure the integrity, the revocation information shall be secured by cryptographic measures like appropriate hash checksums (cf. sec. [6.5\)](#page-55-0).

- <span id="page-68-2"></span>MRS.Req.2: The CA shall ensure that the maintained revocation information are accessible continuously to the relying parties and up to date.
- <span id="page-68-1"></span>MRS.Req.3: The server hosting the maintained revocation information shall be hardened against failure and attacks. The CA shall analyze the risk of a server failure and attacks against the server, taking the assumed traffic to the server into account. If necessary, the IT infrastructure shall be deployed redundantly.
- MRS.Req.4: The revocation information available to the relying parties shall be renewed in regular intervals, which are known to the relying parties; revocation information shall be connected to a expiration date checkable by relying parties.

## <span id="page-68-0"></span>6.12 Physical and environmental security

The CA shall ensure restricted access to its premises, specifically those areas where critical servers and or equipment for key and certificate life-cycle management is located.

#### 6.12.1 Objectives

<span id="page-68-3"></span>PhyE.Obj.1: The CA shall ensure physically separated areas by implementing different security levels, defining security perimeters, authorizing persons the different levels and controlling the physical access properly.

<span id="page-69-8"></span>PhyE.Obj.2: The CA shall implement measures against breakdown of services and against the misuse of sensitive information or media.

#### 6.12.2 Threats

- <span id="page-69-7"></span>PhyE.Threat.1: If critical services are not available, the security and operation of a CA is jeopardized.
- <span id="page-69-3"></span>PhyE.Threat.2: If sensitive information or media is used uninterestedly, handled without protection against damage, lost, unauthorized access or obsolescence or used outside the secure environment, a possible leakage could be used by an attacker to compromise the CA.

# <span id="page-71-0"></span>6.13 Availability of services

A high degree of availability of the services is central for the correct operation of a CA. The availability of the services shall provided towards subscribers and relying parties.

#### 6.13.1 Objectives

For the '[Availability of services](#page-71-0)', the following objectives need to be considered for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-71-1"></span>AS.Obj.1: The CA shall provide a high degree of availability of his services towards subscribers and relying parties. To avoid the misuse of rogue certificates, the availability is highly critical for the service treating the revocation of certificates (cf. [5.7 'Revocation and suspension'](#page-39-0)).

#### 6.13.2 Threats

For the '[Availability of services](#page-71-0)', the following threats can be identified for secure CA operation.

<span id="page-71-9"></span>AS.Threat.1: If the CA does not provide high degree of availability of its services towards the relying parties in the PKI, this does weaken its role as a anchor of confidence for the PKI it operates in. This holds especially for critical services like the availability of revocation information.

#### 6.13.3 Requirements

The following requirements shall be fulfilled by the CA to provide a trustworthy basis for [Availability of ser](#page-71-0)[vices:](#page-71-0)

<span id="page-71-8"></span><span id="page-71-7"></span><span id="page-71-6"></span><span id="page-71-5"></span><span id="page-71-4"></span><span id="page-71-3"></span><span id="page-71-2"></span>

| AS.Req.1: | The CA shall define the maximal down time of each service and tailor the services appro<br>priately. Particularly the service treating the revocation of certificates shall ensure to<br>process inquiries and updates within [assignment: number of hours] hours. Further, the<br>revocation lists provided to the relying parties shall be available continuously.           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AS.Req.2: | The measures defined in the sec. 6.9 'Hardened IT systems and networks supporting log<br>ging and monitoring' shall be implemented to minimize the risk of an outage of the ser<br>vices.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AS.Req.3: | The performance of the technical infrastructure shall be sufficiently tailored for the re<br>quirements and scalable without interrupting the continuous operation. Therefore a<br>analysis of service usage shall be performed before setting-up the technical infrastructure<br>to estimate the traffic.                                                                     |
| AS.Req.4: | The performance of the cryptographic modules shall be tailored for the anticipated traf<br>fic. Relevant parameters include the number of subscribers, the lifecycle of subscriptions<br>and the cost of cryptographic operations per subscriber.                                                                                                                              |
| AS.Req.5: | The CA shall implement appropriate measures against a failure or breakdown of the con<br>tinuous operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| AS.Req.6: | Sensitive technical infrastructure of the operational systems processing services main<br>taining services necessary for CA operation [assignment: list of services for CA operation<br>(i.e. certificate generation )] shall be implemented repetitively in dependency of their high<br>damage potential.                                                                     |
| AS.Req.7: | A backup of data regarding CA operation [assignment: list of type of CA relevant data (i.e.<br>root-certificate) ] in case emergency shall be implemented. This backup shall ensure the<br>operation of the CA in case of an emergency. The backup and restore of the CA shall be<br>operated by reliable personnel fulfilling the requirements stated in sec. 6.8. The backup |

especially of critical data shall be realized physically separated with respect to requirements stated in [6.9.](#page-63-0)

# <span id="page-72-3"></span>6.14 CA termination

This section does describe the cessation of CA operation and it's implications on the respective requirements.

#### 6.14.1 Objectives

- <span id="page-72-2"></span>CT.Obj.1: In case of a CA termination, required obligations and liabilities of the CA shall be preserved by a successor instance for a transition period or a secure termination of all services shall be guaranteed.
- <span id="page-72-1"></span>CT.Obj.2: The CA shall inform subscribers, subjects and relying parties as well as other entities the CA has agreements with successor instances (i.e. third party service providers) prior to it's termination. Therefore the process of the CA termination shall be described in the 'Terms and Conditions' according to sec. [5.2.](#page-15-0)
- <span id="page-72-0"></span>CT.Obj.3: The CA shall transfer obligations to a reliable party for maintaining all information necessary to provide evidence of the operation of the CA terminating for a reasonable retention time.

<span id="page-73-6"></span>CT.Obj.4: The CA shall have arrangements (e.g. insurance) to cover all costs to fulfill the minimum requirements in case the CA operator becomes bankrupt or, for any other reason, is unable to cover the costs by itself within constraints of applicable legislation.

#### 6.14.2 Threats

- <span id="page-73-5"></span>CT.Threat.1: The CA deviates from the standardized handling (e.g. due to an unmaintained role-management) in the termination phase. Subsequently security measures could be affected negatively resulting in lower security level and possibly facilitating several attack paths.
- <span id="page-73-4"></span>CT.Threat.2: If operational actions relating to the key- and certificate life-cycle management are not orderly ended, then private key material or certificates might be retained at the CA infrastructure. An attacker might get access to private key material, certification key material, or certificates and customer data from the registrar.

# <span id="page-74-0"></span>6.15 Requirements for subcontractors

Subcontractors may be used by the CA for certain processes (e.g. as registrar). Therefore certain requirements have to be fulfilled by the subcontractors to uphold the security standard as provided by the CA itself.

The ['Requirements for subcontractors'](#page-74-0) are based on the ['General security requirements'](#page-47-0). If a subcontractor is used to provide a service, it shall have at least the same level of security as the CA. Therefore, if applicable, all requirements defined in all other subsections of chapter [6](#page-47-0) shall also be met by the subcontractor. The CA can influence this by committing the subcontractor to the disseminated Terms and Conditions.

#### 6.15.1 Objectives

- <span id="page-74-4"></span>SubC.Obj.1: The requirements for subcontractors shall be fulfilled to uphold the security standard as provided by the CA itself.
- <span id="page-74-3"></span>SubC.Obj.2: If subcontractors are utilized, the related processes and services shall remain under the control of the CA. The CA shall clearly define the relevant practices to all subcontractors.

#### 6.15.2 Threats

- <span id="page-74-1"></span>SubC.Threat.1: If the responsibilities of subcontractors are not defined clearly, relevant security measures might not be implemented by neither the CA nor the subcontractor.
- SubC.Threat.2: Security measures in the area of responsibility of the subcontractor are not implemented or implemented insufficiently, leading to the risk of compromise of the CA operation.

#### 6.15.3 Requirements

The CA shall ensure following requirements:

<span id="page-74-2"></span>SubC.Req.1: The CA should be aware that it has liability also for the services offered by the subcontractor. The CA shall retain responsibility for all aspects of the provision of services within the scope of its service policy, whether or not functions are outsourced to subcontractors.

<span id="page-75-1"></span><span id="page-75-0"></span>

| SubC.Req.2: | Responsibilities of third parties shall be clearly defined by the CA and appropriate ar<br>rangements made to ensure that subcontractors are bound to implement any controls re<br>quired by the CA.                                                                              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SubC.Req.3: | The CA shall retain responsibility for the disclosure of relevant practices to all subcon<br>tractors.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| SubC.Req.4: | The operations of the subcontractor must be subject to an audit against the requirements<br>from this TR to the same extend as the operations would be audited if they were provided<br>by the CA itself. This requirement must be a contractual obligation of the subcontractor. |
