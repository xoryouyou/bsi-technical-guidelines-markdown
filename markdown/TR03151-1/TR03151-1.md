# 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

In the course of digitalisation, many applications nowadays rely on digital signatures in order to protect the authenticity and integrity of information. Due to legal or organisational requirements, such applications need a certain level of protection of their signature keys, i.e. private signature keys must be protected from unauthorized usage and disclosure via a suitable secure component. Such a level of protection can be achieved by the usage of a Secure Element (SE).

This Technical Guideline specifies the Secure Element Application Programming Interface (SE API). The SE API is a digital interface that wraps functionality of a device containing a Secure Element and allows access to security functionalities by an application in a standardized way, regardless of the specific type of Secure Element in use (see Figure 1). In the context of particular use cases, it can also be necessary to include a storage medium.

Figure 1 General system architecture in the SE API context

## 1.2 Purpose and general functionality of the API

Currently, the main purpose of the device that implements this interface is to secure authenticity and integrity of information by creating digital signatures over them. The functionality of this API might grow to provide a broader set of cryptographic functions at a later point in time, but for the moment is restricted to the creation of signatures over externally provided data. The interface additionally provides functionalities to authenticate users, manage the device, create signature protected logs, and to export logs.

### 1.3 Scope of this Technical Guideline

The Technical Guideline BSI TR-03151 is split into multiple parts:

- Part 1 describes the creation and structure of log messages, their export, utility functions, and the specification of the integration interfaces towards the application.
- Part 2, the Technical Guideline [BSI TR-03151-2], describes and defines the mapping of the functionality and data types provided in part 1 to different programming and interface languages.

The integration interface is defined in the OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL) - a generic interface description language. The OMG IDL [OMG2017a] is a text based, language independent definition language for interfaces.

The descriptions in this document are designed to be independent of any concrete implementation. Possible implementations of an API as described in this document include (but are not limited to) a REST-API or the direct exposition of a classical API from the programming language that the API is developed in.

Neither the physical interface, by which the SE API is exposed, nor any other layers in terms of the ISO/OSI reference model are defined by this Technical Guideline. This allows a maximum degree of flexibility for a Secure Element application developer.

The functions of the SE API are described regarding their function parameters, their behavior, and the exceptions. The interaction between the API and the Secure Element is only considered in an abstract, technologically independent way.

The system that implements the interface and functions described in this document is in the following referred to as device for short.

## 1.4 Referencing and restricting this Technical Guideline

This Technical Guideline is written with the intent for it to be referenced by a superordinate guideline. This referencing guideline may provide narrower requirements and restrictions e.g. specifying the hardware requirements or the location of the time source.

When describing functionalities, this Technical Guideline assumes the usage of a Secure Element 'behind' the API. But the uage of a specific Secure Element is, by the sole perspective of this guideline, not restricted. Any 'security module' (hard or software based) could be used. This might, as stated above, of course be limited or forbidden by a guideline referencing this document. For the purpose of textual simplification the term Secure Element is used (as a place holder) throughout the whole document.

In addition, this Technical Guideline provides a functionality to restrict the usage of functions to certain roles or users. The actual restriction or permission of the usage of a function (user permission) is not regulated by this document and it is therefore assumed that a referencing guideline provides a limiting rule set.

The Technical Guideline does not regulate which functions of the API are to be implemented. It is therefore assumed that a referencing guideline provides information about the sets of mandatory and optional functions and functionalities.

### 1.5 Key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document SHALL be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

The key word "CONDITIONAL" is to be interpreted as follows: The usage of an item is dependent on the usage of other items. It is therefore further qualified under which conditions the item is REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED.

When used in tables (profiles), the key words are abbreviated as shown in Table 2.

# 2 Logging of events

### 2.1 Logging introduction

Log messages created by the device document events that happened during the usage / life cycle of the device. They can also document externally provided information fed to the device.

Opposed to a simple log file, the device creates cryptographically signed log messages.

The log messages contain:

- data (information) to be protected,
- protocol data that is generated by a Secure Element during the logging process,
- and a signature created by the Secure Element protecting this data.

The following two core types of log messages and types of data are distinguished within this Technical Guideline:

- System logs:
	- o MUST be used to protect information (system events) e.g. of the invocation of a system operation of the API.
- Audit logs:
	- o MUST be used to protect data of auditable events (audit data) created by the Secure Element.

The third type of log messages and type of data is the transaction log:

- Transaction logs
	- o MUST be used to protect external data (transaction data) that is passed to the Secure Element via the API.

The two core log message types system log and audit log are described in chapters 2.2 and 2.3. The description of transaction logs can be found in chapter 3.7.

### 2.1.1 Common log message structure

Log messages created by the device follow a basic structure, which can be expressed by the following ASN.1 statement:

| LogMessage<br>::=                                                                              | SEQUENCE {                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version<br>certifiedDataType                                                                   | INTEGER (3),<br>OBJECT IDENTIFIER (<br>id-SE-API-transaction-log  <br>id-SE-API-system-log  <br>id-SE-API-SE-audit-log), |
| certifiedData                                                                                  | ANY DEFINED BY certifiedDataType,                                                                                        |
| serialNumber<br>signatureAlgorithm<br>seAuditData<br>signatureCounter<br>signatureCreationTime | OCTET STRING (SIZE (32)),<br>AlgorithmIdentifier,<br>OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,<br>INTEGER,<br>Time,                         |

signatureValue OCTET STRING

This structure is the same for all derived log message types, with one exception:

• The element "certifiedData" is replaced by one or more log message type specific elements. Therefore the element shown is a mere placeholder.

Disclaimer: Even if individual elements of log messages may be categorized as not mandatory, it is possible that the usage of this structure is further refined in this document or by the respective requirements given by a Technical Guideline referencing this document.

Table 3 Description of the elements of the log message

### 2.1.3 Log message encoding

All log messages described in this document MUST be encoded in the ASN.1 DER format specified in [X690], unless specified otherwise.

In addition the following rules MUST be obliged:

- Elements denoted as OPTIONAL in the ASN.1 description MUST NOT be present in the encoded representation (log message) if
	- o this or a referencing guideline prohibits them from being used in a certain situation or
	- o this or a referencing guideline allows them to be absent and they contain no content.
- Mandatory elements that are empty MUST be present and encode the empty value by setting the length element to 0x00. The content element (the V in TLV) SHALL NOT be present (contain any octets)

Note: A simplified introduction into the DER encoding can be found in Appendix D.

If an element is implicitly tagged (e.g. 0x81) it SHALL NOT be explicitly tagged in addition e.g. with the universal class tags. For example, a sequence tagged 0xA1 SHALL NOT be appended by a 0x30.

#### 2.1.4 Log message signature

To protect the integrity and authenticity of log messages they MUST be cryptographically signed with a private key protected by the Secure Element.

The private key MUST NOT be used for purposes other than signing log messages. The first signature created by a private key MAY be used to sign a certificate request.

#### 2.1.4.1 Elements protected by the signature

Every log message consists of a sequence of elements (It is an ASN.1 sequence as well). The last element in the sequence is a cryptographic signature. This signature MUST be calculated over all preceding elements in this sequence.

Therefore, the input to the signature generation and verification process consists of the concatenation of all the signature preceding log message elements, i.e. the following elements (if present):

- version
- certifiedDataType
- eventType1
- eventData1
- serialNumber
- signatureAlgorithm
- signatureCounter
- signatureCreationTime

#### 2.1.4.2 Signature computation

All elements MUST be concatenated with tag and length values present and no additional data interlaced, therefore building the same pattern as if present in the encoded log message (without the leading outer sequence and ending with the last element before signatureValue).

For signature calculation, all elements MUST be DER encoded except for the field processData of a transaction log, when indefinite length encoding applies (cf. section 3.7.2.3).

The signature MUST be computed using the private key that belongs to the certificate to be used for the verification of the corresponding log message type. The key pair MUST be managed by the Secure Element.

The details of the signature computation depend on the particular signature algorithm employed.

#### 2.1.4.3 Signature verification

The log message signature verification SHALL be performed analogue to the signature creation using the public key of the certificate for the verification of the given log message type.

<sup>1</sup> In this example eventType and eventData replaced the placeholder certifiedData.

Federal Office for Information Security 11

The validity of the provided certificate chain MUST be verified using a trust anchor, which is obtained from a trusted source. The certificate used to verify a signature MUST be verified using the certificate chain provided.

The serial number contained in the log message MUST be compared to the hash of the public key included in the certificate.

#### 2.1.5 Log messages object identifiers

As stated above, the device can produce three different types of log messages. Each type of log message can be identified by a unique object identifier (a number string) present in the second element of a log message, the element certifiedDataType.

#### 2.1.5.1 System log object identifier

A system log MUST be identified by the following object identifier id-SE-API-system-log using the field certifiedDataType of a log message:

• bsi-de (0.4.0.127.0.7) applications (3) id-SE-API (7) id-SE-API-dataformats (1) 2

The ASN.1 definition is:

| id-SE-API             | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {bsi-de applications (3) 7} |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| id-SE-API-dataformats | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {id-SE-API 1}               |
| id-SE-API-system-log  | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {id-SE-API-dataformats 2}   |

#### 2.1.5.2 Transaction log object identifier

A transaction log MUST be identified by the following object identifier id-SE-API-transaction-log using the field certifiedDataType of a log message:

• bsi-de (0.4.0.127.0.7) applications (3) id-SE-API (7) id-SE-API-dataformats (1) 1

The ASN.1 definition is:

| id-SE-API                 | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {bsi-de applications (3) 7} |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| id-SE-API-dataformats     | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {id-SE-API 1}               |
| id-SE-API-transaction-log | OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= | {id-SE-API-dataformats 1}   |

#### 2.1.5.3 Audit log object identifier

An audit log MUST be identified by the following object identifier id-SE-API-SE-audit-log using the field certifiedDataType of a log message:

• bsi-de (0.4.0.127.0.7) applications (3) id-SE-API (7) id-SE-API-dataformats (1) 3

The ASN.1 definition is:

```
id-SE-API OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {bsi-de applications (3) 7} 
id-SE-API-dataformats OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-SE-API 1} 
id-SE-API-SE-audit-log OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-SE-API-dataformats 3}
```
#### 2.1.6 Log message time source

If additional time-stamps (in addition to the signature creation time) are present in a log message they MUST be encoded in the same format as the signature creation time. In addition the time source for those additional time-stamps MUST be either the same as for the signature creation time or a time source that is synced to the time source for the signature creation time. A synced time source MUST adhere to the specifications in 3.5.1 an MUST therefore NOT differ in time zone.

### 2.2 Logging of system logs

### 2.2.1 System log message format

Other elements MUST NOT be present.

#### 2.2.1.3 Example of the correct (re-)placement of the eventData field

The following example shows how the eventData placeholder element has been properly replaced by the type specific element, in this case AuthenticateUserEventData in an authenticateUser system log:

```
AuthenticateUserSystemLogMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
```

```
version INTEGER (3),
certifiedDataType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ( id-SE-API-system-log ), 

eventType [0] IMPLICIT PrintableString ( "authenticateUser" ), 
eventOrigin [1] IMPLICIT PrintableString OPTIONAL, 
eventTriggerdByUser [2] IMPLICIT UserId OPTIONAL,

serialNumber OCTET STRING (SIZE (32)), 
signatureAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier, 
signatureCounter INTEGER, 
signatureCreationTime Time, 
signatureValue OCTET STRING 
}
```
### 2.3 Logging of audit logs

Audit logs are used to protect data of auditable events (audit data) created by the Secure Element.

The specification of auditable events and the corresponding seAuditData depend on the particular Secure Element used and is out of scope of this Technical Guideline.

Table 5 Description of the elements of an audit log message

Additional elements MUST NOT be present.

### 2.4 Logging of not specified logs

All log messages created by the device MUST adhere to this specification. The format MUST NOT be altered. Additional log messages MUST NOT be created.

A referencing guideline MAY define and allow the creation and export of additional log messages.

## 2.5 Export format for log messages and additional information

### 2.5.1 TAR container

If the export of information (e.g. logs) is requested, the requested information SHALL be exported into a [POSIX.1-2001] compliant TAR archive that in turn contains the following files:

- the initialization information
- the log messages
- the certificate(s) that are needed to verify the log messages

Only files that are defined by this or a referencing guideline and are specified to be exported SHALL be contained in the TAR container. There SHALL be no additional files.

Further definitions regarding the TAR archive are contained in Appendix B.

### 2.5.2 TAR container file names

The TAR archive SHALL have file names that conform to the structure defined in Text 1.

The capitalized parts of the file name that are separated by an underscore represent particular information from the export (see Text 1). These parts SHALL be replaced by the corresponding values according to Table 6. If the name for a file name part or a predefined value consists of several terms, these terms are connected by a hyphen-minus.

A TAR archive file SHALL have the file extension tar or tar.n where n is an integer between 001 and 999. The file extension SHALL be separated by a point from the rest of the file name.

#### Export\_DATE-FORMAT\_DATE.tar[.FILE-COUNTER]

Table 6 Parts of the file names of TAR archives

Text 2 shows an example for the name of a TAR archive file. The value 20181109084236Z represents the time value for the creation of the tar archive that replaced DATE. In the example, the value Gent for DATE-FORMAT indicates that the date/time value is formatted in the ASN.1 type GeneralizedTime (see chapter 3.5.1). The placeholder FILE-COUNTER is not used, as only one file is exported.

Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar

Text 2 Example for a file name of a single tar archive

Text 3 shows an example for the names of a TAR archive that is split in three files. The value 20181109084236Z represents the time value for the creation of the TAR archive that replaced DATE. In the example, the value Gent for DATE-FORMAT indicates that the date/time value is formatted in the ASN.1 type GeneralizedTime (see 3.5.1). The placeholder FILE-COUNTER is used. The concatenation of the three files "Export\_[...].001 || Export\_[...].002 || Export\_[...].003" forms the tar archive that would be exported, if only one archive file were created.2

Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.001 Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.002 Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.003

#### 2.5.2.1 TAR container file names for exported certificates

File names of TAR containers SHALL adhere to the specifications made in 2.5.2 with the alteration that the preceding string "Export" of the filename SHALL be replaced by the string "CertificateExport". Therefore the TAR archive SHALL have file names that conform to the structure defined in Text 4.

CertificateExport\_DATE-FORMAT\_DATE.tar[.FILE-COUNTER]

Text 4 Structure of file names for TAR archives exporting certificates

### 2.5.3 Device Information File

The TAR archive SHALL contain a file named info.csv. This comma separated value (CSV) text file SHALL follow the structure shown in Text 5.

```
"component:",$1,"manufacturer:",$2,"model:",$3,"version:",$4,"certification-id:",$5[
"component:",$1,"manufacturer:",$2,"model:",$3,"version:",$4,"certification-id:",$5] 
"description:",$6,,,,,,,,
```
Text 5 Content of info.csv

<sup>2</sup> Such a concatenation may be done using the Unix command "cat Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.001 Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.002 Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar.003 > Export\_Gent\_20181109084236Z.tar".

The specifications in the square brackets are OPTIONAL and MAY appear zero or more times. The seven commas have been inserted at the end so that there is the same number of entries in each line.

The variables \$1 to \$6 SHALL be replaced with the following values:

- \$1 is to be replaced by the generic type of the component, whose properties are described in this line.
- \$2 is to be replaced by the manufacturer information of the component that is described in this line.
- \$3 is to be replaced by the model information of the component that is described in this line.
- \$4 is to be replaced by the version information of the component that is described in this line.
- \$5 is to be replaced by the certification id(s) of the component that is described in this line, separated by commas. For cases where there are no certifications in the context of the device, \$5 SHALL be empty.
- \$6 is to be replaced by the description of the device, set by the manufacturer or using the function setDescription. If the data for the description has not been set by the manufacturer and the function setDescription was not executed, \$6 SHALL be empty.

Line endings in the text file SHALL be encoded in UNIX style, i.e. new lines are indicated by a line feed character (LF / 0x0A). A carriage return character ( CR / 0x0D) SHALL NOT be used. The delimiter SHALL be a comma character ( , / 0x2C).

All information in Text 5 SHALL be encapsulated in double quotes. As the values (\$1, \$2, \$3, \$4, \$5, \$6) are encapsulated in double quotes, the values may contain commas. If a value contains double quotes, it SHALL be escaped according to [RFC 4180].

The file "info.csv" SHALL NOT provide any additional information.

### 2.5.4 Certificate file names

The TAR archive SHALL contain all certificates needed to verify the exported log messages. These certificates SHALL be encoded as X.509 certificates according to [X509].

#### SERIAL\_TYPE.EXTENSION

Text 6 Structure of file name for certificates

Each certificate SHALL be included in the TAR archive as a separate file. The structure of file names of certificates SHALL conform to the definition in Text 6. The capitalized parts of the file name structure SHALL be replaced by values defined in Table 7.

| Part of file name | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SERIAL            | This part of the file name SHALL be the hash of the public key used in the<br>certificate.<br>It SHALL NOT be base64 encoded. The string of the serial number SHALL be the |
|                   | representation of hex values such as aaff99.                                                                                                                               |

|                   | The certificate type is indicated by the following value:                                                                                                                  |
|                   | - X509 corresponds to X.509 certificates                                                                                                                                   |

| Part of file name | Description                                                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EXTENSION         | SHALL represent the file extensions for the different certificate types.          |
|                   | The file extensions SHALL conform to the following values:                        |
|                   | - X.509: The extension SHALL be cer, CER, crt, CRT, pem, PEM, der or DER          |
|                   | The extension of the file name SHALL be separated by a point from the rest of the |
|                   | file name.                                                                        |

Table 7 Parts of the file names of certificates in export TAR archives

Text 7 shows an example for the file name of a certificate. The value X509 for TYPE indicates that the certificate is an X.509 certificate. The serial number is represented by the value ca54f563941228305fa4c772fa9427b31464f439d7b2907fb0fdca9571fde1ed that replaced SERIAL. The file extension is cer.

#### 2.5.5 Log message file names

#### 2.5.5.1 System log file names

System log message files in a TAR archive SHALL have file names that conform to the structure defined in Text 8.

The capitalized parts of the file name that are separated by an underscore represent particular information of a system log message (see Text 8). These parts SHALL be replaced by the corresponding values according to Table 8.

DATE-FORMAT\_DATE\_Sig-SIGNATURE-COUNTER\_LOG\_TYPE[\_Fc-FILE-COUNTER].log

Text 8 Structure of file names for system log messages. The specifications in the square brackets are CONDITIONAL (see Table 8).

If the name for a file name part or a predefined value consists of several terms, these terms are connected by a hyphen-minus sign.

To facilitate the identification of the values for the signature counter and an optional file counter in the file name, this information SHALL be marked by the prefix Sig or Fc, respectively (see italic content in Text 8). A prefix SHALL be connected by a hyphen-minus sign to the corresponding value. A system log message file SHALL have the file extension log. The file extension SHALL be separated by a point from the rest of the file name.

Table 8 Parts of the file names of system log messages in export TAR archive

Text 9 shows an example for the name of a system log message file. Thus, the file name part LOG has been replaced by the value Log-Sys. The value updateTime for the file name part TYPE indicates that the system log message corresponds to an update of the time managed by the Secure Element. It can be seen that the value 1743 for the signature counter is marked by the prefix Sig. The prefix is connected to the signature counter value by a hyphen-minus sign. The value 20181109084236Z represents the time value for the creation of the system log message that replaced DATE. In the example, the value Gent for DATE-FORMAT indicates that the date/time value is formatted in the ASN.1 type GeneralizedTime (see chapter 3.5.1).

Table 9 Parts of the file names of audit log messages in export TAR archive

In Text 11 an example for the name of an audit log message file is shown. The audit log message file can be identified by the value Log-Aud that has replaced LOG. It can be seen that the value 1853 for the signature counter is marked by the prefix Sig. The prefix is connected to the signature counter value by a hyphen-minus sign. The value 1543565694 represents the time value for the creation of the audit log message that replaced DATE. In the example, the value Unixt for DATE-FORMAT indicates that the date/time value is formatted in Unix Time (see 3.5.1). The value represents the date/time 9 hours, 14 minutes and 54 seconds at the 30th of November in the year 2018. The value for the FILE-COUNTER indicates that one file of the same name is already existing. The value for FILE-COUNTER is marked by the prefix Fc.

Table 10 Parts of the file names for transaction log messages in export tar archive

Text 13 provides an example for the file name of a transaction log message for the start of a transaction. Thus, the file name part LOG has been replaced by the predefined value Log-Tra (see Table 10). TYPE has been substituted by the predefined value Start. The creation date/time of the log message is represented by the value 181109153045Z. The value Utc for DATE\_FORMAT indicates that the format of this date/time value conforms to the type UTCTime from ASN.1 (see chapter 3.5.1). The value 1572 for the signature counter is marked by the prefix Sig. The transaction number has the value 713 that is marked by the prefix No. The client id has the value 03. It is marked by the prefix Client. The absence of a value for FILE-COUNTER indicates that no files of the same name are existing.

### 3.1 Error handling

If an application receives any kind of error from the API, it is the responsibility of the application to react appropriately to this error. Depending on the concrete function that raised ("threw") the error and depending on the concrete error, the application may:

- decide to do nothing at all,
- simply repeat the last function call,
- repeat a larger amount of steps.

### 3.1.1 List of all exceptions

The following table provides a list of all exceptions that can be raised ("thrown") when calling an API function:

Table 12 List of exceptions

Every function description within this document will provide further details on exceptions that are to be expected when calling the function. The specific exceptions MUST be provided by each function.

### 3.1.2 Common exceptions

The following subchapters further refine and/or explain exceptions that are relevant for several of the API functions. Each exception, except of ErrorFunctionNotSupported, SHALL be supported by all functions that list this exception in the subchapter "Exceptions" of their function description.

If not stated otherwise in the following subchapters or in the detailed description of a function, the check leading to the raising of an exception MAY be performed at discretion of the device developer.

### 3.1.2.1 ErrorFunctionFailed

The exception ErrorFunctionFailed SHALL be raised whenever a critical error occurs during the execution of the called function and the error is not covered by any other defined exception. A critical error in this context is any error that actually prevents the function from executing the defined process and from producing the expected and defined results.

#### 3.1.2.2 ErrorDeviceNotInitialized

The exception ErrorDeviceNotInitialized SHALL be implemented by all functions that require the device to be initialized before a correct usage of the function.

#### 3.1.2.3 ErrorTimeNotSet

The exception ErrorTimeNotSet SHALL be implemented by all functions of the API that require a correctly set time source in the Secure Element.

This exception SHALL be raised if a function is invoked although the time managed by the Secure Element has not been set.

#### 3.1.2.4 ErrorCertificateExpired

The exception SHALL be raised if a function isinvoked and the certificate corresponding to a private key used to create log messages is expired. Even if a certificate is expired, the log message SHALL be created by the Secure Element and stored by the device. In this case, the exception ErrorCertificateExpired SHALL be raised only after the data of the log message has been stored.

The exception ErrorCertificateExpired MAY be implemented by the API function initialize.

#### 3.1.2.5 ErrorSecureElementDisabled

This exception SHALL be raised by functions which depend on a non-disabled Secure Element when the Secure Element has been disabled.

#### 3.1.2.6 ErrorParameterTooLong

The exception ErrorParameterTooLong SHALL be implemented by all functions of the API that expect input parameters.

The exception SHALL be raised if at least one of the passed parameters is too long.

#### 3.1.2.7 ErrorParameterSyntax

The exception ErrorParameterSyntax SHALL be implemented by all functions of the API that expect input or output parameters.

The exception SHALL be raised if the passed parameters are not of valid type. Especially, the exception SHALL be raised if no memory area is passed or the passed parameter is of a wrong type.

#### 3.1.2.8 ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow

The exception ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow SHALL be implemented by all functions which create a log message during their execution.

The exception ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow SHALL be raised if the signature counter provided by the secure element has reached its maximal value.

#### 3.1.2.9 ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted

The exception ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted SHALL be implemented by all functions which create a log message during their execution.

The exception ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted SHALL be raised if the physical memory of the signature counter can no longer guarantee error-free operation of the counter.

#### 3.1.2.10 ErrorFunctionNotSupported

The exception ErrorFunctionNotSupported SHALL be implemented by all functions defined in this document, if the functionality of the function is not fully or correctly implemented. It SHALL be raised when the function is invoked.

It SHALL be raised instantly after invoking the function. There SHALL be no other functionality performed by the device except of raising the exception when calling an unsupported function.

Note: Whether the implementation of a function is to be considered optional may depend on restrictions and specifications made by a referencing document / guideline.

#### 3.1.2.11 ErrorStorageMediumDisconnected

The exception ErrorStorageMedium SHALL be implemented by all functions that write data to the storage medium of the device or expect the storage medium to be available.

The check for availability of the storage medium SHALL be performed before the core functionality of the called function is performed.

The exception SHALL only be raised if other condition checks before the core functionality of the function did not fail before. For example, in case of access restricted functions the exception SHALL only be raised after a successful authentication check.

### 3.1.2.12 ErrorStorageMemoryFull

The exception ErrorStorageMemoryFull SHALL be implemented by all functions that write data to the storage medium of the device or expect a certain amount of available free space on the storage medium. The function deleteLogMessages is except from this requirement and SHALL NOT implement this exception.

The exception SHALL be raised when the storage memory is filled to a degree that the device is dangerously close to not being able to store data (e.g. log messages). To prevent deadlocks the device SHALL preserve a sufficient amount of buffer memory to store logs created by the device for events not triggered by an external user (e.g. audit logs) and to allow the usage of the function deleteLogMessages.

The exception SHALL only be raised if other condition checks before the core functionality of the function did not fail before. For example, in case of access restricted functions the exception SHALL only be raised after a successful authentication check.

In general the check for full storage memory SHALL be performed before the core functionality of the called function is performed.

For the following functions the check for full storage memory SHALL be raised only after the regular functionality has been performed (e.g. the regular log messages have been stored):

- authenticateUser
- logOut
- unblockPin
- initialize
- selfTest
- updateTime

### 3.2 Authorization and authentication of users

### 3.2.1 Restricted usage of functions

The usage of the API functions SHOULD be and usually isrestricted to authorized users (e.g. an administrator). In most cases the guideline that references this guideline restricts the usage of functions and functionalities to certain users assuming a specific role3 . The topic of user and role management is not covered in this specification.

In the following the term "user" is used synonymously for human users and applications.

An authorized user SHALL be identified by the device by a unique identifier (userId).

### 3.2.2 Authentication of Users

This chapter provides the description of basic functions to authenticate and log out users as well as to change their passwords.

The following functionalities are not provided / specified in this document:

• Manage and display users

 <sup>3</sup> The referencing guideline might grant the role of an unauthenticated user further rights than to a certain authenticated user.

- Manage and display the authorization of a user
- Manage and display rights profiles of a user
- Manage and display roles that are granted to a user
- Role management (creation, deletion, attribution)

The device SHALL manage the status of the authentication of authorized users. Additionally, the device SHALL manage the assignment of roles (e.g. admin) to authorized users.

The API description provided by this guideline assumes and expects that only one user at a time can use the API. The API is not designed to handle multiple logged in users simultaneously using an API instance, as it can not determine which user called which function. Therefore, the device SHALL NOT allow more than one user per API instance to have the status "authenticated" at any time. For the purpose of this technical guideline, the possibility of different users using distinguished API instances is not taken into account.

#### 3.2.2.1 PIN authentication

Users of the device authenticate against the device by using a PIN.

The following requirements and assumptions for the authentication of users with a PIN are made:

- The device SHALL authenticate an authorized user by a PIN.
- A limit for successive entries of a wrong PIN by a user SHALL be defined. In this context, the Secure Element SHALL manage a PIN retry counter for every authorized user.
- If the limit for the successive entries of incorrect PINs for a user is reached, the Secure Element SHALL block that user's PIN entry.
- The authentication of authorized users by the device is implemented by the function authenticateUser (see chapter 3.2.3).
- In addition to the PIN, a user SHALL have a Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) that enables an unblocking of the PIN entry.
- Countermeasures against password guessing attacks SHALL be implemented.
- If a correct PUK has been entered, the user SHALL be unblocked and the user SHALL be able to change the PIN.
- The unblocking of a user is implemented by the function unblockPin (see chapter 3.2.5).
- After authorized users have finished their current usage of the restricted functions, they SHALL log out from the device. This log-out is implemented by the function logOut (see chapter 4.7.2).
- If an authenticated user does not invoke a function for an appropriate period of time, the device SHALL log out the user automatically.
- After the log out of an authenticated user, the device SHALL set the corresponding status for the user to "not authenticated".

General requirement:

• The combinations of UserID, PIN, PUK and role for the authorized users SHALL be managed by the Secure Element.

#### 3.2.2.2 Automatic log out

In the case of an automatic log out, a log message as described in chapter 3.2.4.3 MUST be created. The device SHALL determine the userId to be logged out by itself as well as the logout cause, without a need to call the API function logOut. An automatic log out uses the functionality of the Secure Element to determine the log message parts for the event data regarding the log out, retrieving the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element, and storing the data of the previously retrieved log message parts on the storage medium. If the automatic log out was triggered by the execution of another API function, the device SHALL forward the common exceptions ErrorSigningEventDataFailed, ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed, and ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed to that other function, if the conditions under which those exceptions are commonly thrown apply (see p.e. chapter 3.2.4.5).

### 3.2.3 authenticateUser – Function

The function authenticateUser enables an authorized user or system to authenticate to the device for the usage of restricted API functions (see chapter 3.2.1).

The Secure Element MAY create (signed) log messages for authentication functions, even if it has not been initialized.4

#### 3.2.3.1 authenticateUser – Input parameters

#### 3.2.3.4 authenticateUser – Exceptions

The following exceptions can occur when calling the function authenticateUser:

- ErrorFunctionFailed
- ErrorFunctionNotSupported
- ErrorIncorrectPin
- ErrorParameterSyntax
- ErrorParameterTooLong
- ErrorPinBlocked
- ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed
- ErrorSecureElementDisabled
- ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected
- ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow
- ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted
- ErrorSigningEventDataFailed
- ErrorStorageMediumDisconnected
- ErrorStorageMemoryFull
- ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed
- ErrorUnknownUserId

#### 3.2.3.5 authenticateUser – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behaviour of the function authenticateUser in detail:

- 1. The function SHALL check if the value for the passed userId is managed by the device. If the passed userId is not managed by the device, the function SHALL perform the tasks defined in chapter 3.2.3.5.1 to log the failed authentication attempt. The element authenticationResult SHALL be set to the value "unkownUserId". Afterwards the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUnknownUserId and exit the function.
- 2. The function SHALL check for the userId if the corresponding PIN retry counter has a value greater than 0. The PIN retry counter SHALL represent the number of remaining attempts for entering a wrong PIN. If the value is not greater than 0, the function SHALL perform the tasks defined in chapter 3.2.3.5.1 to log the failed authentication attempt. The element authenticationResult SHALL be set to the value "pinBlocked". Afterwards the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorPinBlocked and exit the function.
- 3. If the PIN retry counter is greater than 0, the function SHALL decrement the value of the PIN retry counter.
- 4. The function SHALL check the passed PIN. If the PIN is not correct, the function SHALL perform the tasks defined in chapter 3.2.3.5.1 to log the failed authentication attempt. The element authenticationResult SHALL be set to the value "incorrectPin". Afterwards the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorIncorrectPin and exit the function. The function SHOULD provide additional information on the PIN retry counter value alongside the exception.
- 5. If the PIN is correct, the function SHALL check if another user (a user with a different userId than the one attempting to authenticate themselves) currently has the status "authenticated". If another user has the status "authenticated", the function SHALL perform an automatic log out as described in chapter 3.2.2.2 before continuing the execution of authenticateUser. If an exception is raised during the creation of the log message for the automatic log out, the function authenticateUser SHALL raise that exception as well and exit the function.
- 6. The function SHALL set the authentication status for the userId to "authenticated". Additionally, the function SHALL set the value for the PIN retry counter to the defined maximum value for retries.
- 7. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to determine the log message parts for the event data of the successful authentication attempt. The element authenticationResult SHALL be set to the value "success". If the execution of this Secure Element functionality fails, the function authenticateUser SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 8. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 9. The function SHALL store the data of the previously retrieved log message parts on the storage medium. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 10. The function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function has been successful.

#### 3.2.3.5.1 Detailed description of actions to log a failed authentication attempt

The following tasks SHALL be performed by the function authenticateUser to log a failed authentication attempt:

- 1. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to determine the log message parts for the event data for the failed authentication attempt. If the execution of this Secure Element functionality fails, the function authenticateUser SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 2. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed.
- 3. The function SHALL store the data of the previously retrieved log message parts on the storage medium. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.

#### 3.3.5.6 updateDevice – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behaviour of the function updateDevice in detail:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users , the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. The function SHALL check if there are open transactions that are currently managed by the Secure Element. If at least one transaction was started but is not finished and not classified abandoned, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorOpenTransactionFound and exit the function.
- 4. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 5. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the log message parts to log the start of the update.
- 6. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 7. The function SHALL store the data of the retrieved log message parts. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 8. The function SHALL update the device.

The following steps MUST be performed, but MAY be performed after the initial function call to updateDevice has been terminated – for example because of a reboot of the device which is part of the update process. The steps are in any case still logically considered part of the updateDevice function.

- 9. If the update process fails, the function SHALL perform the steps described in 3.3.5.6.1 to log the failed update attempt. This includes the termination of the function updateDevice.
- 10. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the log message parts to log the completion of the update.
- 11. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 12. The function SHALL store the data of the retrieved log message parts. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 13. The function SHOULD return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function updateDevice has been successful.

#### 3.3.5.6.1 Detailed description of actions to log a failed update attempt

The following tasks SHALL be performed by the function updateDevice to log a failed update attempt:

- 1. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to determine the log message parts for the event data for the failed update attempt. If the execution of this Secure Element functionality fails, the function updateDevice SHOULD raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 2. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 3. The function SHALL store the data of the previously retrieved log message parts on the storage medium. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 4. The function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorUpdateDeviceFailed and exit the function.

#### 3.5.2.5 updateTime – Detailed Description

The following description specifies the behavior of the updateTime function in detail:

1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated usersto the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked

the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.

- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. If the function updateTime is invoked
	- 1. without an input parameter, the function SHALL instruct the Secure Element to use its time synchronization mechanism to update the local time. If the API implementation of the function allows to call the function without parameters even though no time synchronization function is implemented, the function shall raise the exception ErrorUnsupportedTimeSyncVariant and exit the function. If the execution fails for any other reason, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUpdateTimeFailed and exit the function.
	- 2. with a value for the input parameter newDateTime, the function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to set the time with the provided newDateTime. If the API implementation of the function allows to call the function with parameters even though it does not implement the direct update of the time by passing parameters, the function shall raise the exception ErrorUnsupportedTimeSyncVariant and exit the function. If the execution fails for any other reason, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUpdateTimeFailed and exit the function.
- 4. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the log message parts to log the time change and to pass the relevant data to the Secure Element. If the execution fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 5. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 6. The function SHALL store the data of the previously retrieved log message parts on the storage medium. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 7. The function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function updateTime has been successful.

### 3.5.3 getTimeSyncVariant– Function

The function getTimeSyncVariant can be used to obtain information how updates of the current date/time are performed. The following variants for updating the current date/time can be supported:

- 4. If no certificate of the same file name already exists, the function SHALL store the passed certificates. If a certificate has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRestoreFailed and exit the function.
- 5. If the restoring has been successful, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function has been successful.

Note: In any case, it SHALL be ensured that the storage is left in a consistent state, even if the restore functionality failed.

#### 3.6.8.3 getLastLogMessage – Exceptions

The following exceptions can occur when calling the function getLastLogMessage:

- ErrorDeviceNotInitialized
- ErrorFunctionFailed
- ErrorFunctionNotSupported
- ErrorNoLogMessageFound
- ErrorParameterSyntax
- ErrorReadingLogMessage
- ErrorSecureElementDisabled
- ErrorStorageMediumDisconnected
- ErrorUserNotAuthenticated
- ErrorUserNotAuthorized

#### 3.6.8.4 getLastLogMessage – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behavior of the getLastLogMessage function in detail:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the

function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.

- 3. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element most recently. If no log message parts are found in the Secure Element, the exception ErrorNoLogMessageFound SHALL be raised and the function SHALL be exited. If the retrieving of the log message parts fails, the exception ErrorReadingLogMessage SHALL be raised and the function SHALL be exited.
- 4. The retrieved log message parts SHALL be combined into a complete log message. This log message SHALL be returned to the application over the output parameter logMessageContent and logMessageFileName. Additionally, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function has been successful.

### 3.7 Logging of external data

The API supports the protection of externally provided data by adding a unique transaction number, a timestamp, and a signature to it. The time-stamp provides information about the point in time when the signature creation was performed. Furthermore, a signature counter that is increased with every signature allows to easily detect the absence of a signature. The externally provided data and the two additional parameters time and counter are protected by the signature against unnoticed manipulation.

The device or system that implements the API works in the following way:

- 1. Externally provided data flows via the API into the system.
- 2. In the system, the data is forwarded to the Secure Element.
- 3. If required, the Secure Element creates a new transaction number for the current transaction.
- 4. The Secure Element creates a signature over the data and the additional self-provided data (a timestamp, a signature counter and other information).
- 5. Then, the device composes and returns a log message. The log message contains the signature and all additional data that was used in the signature creation process (and is needed to verify the signature).

The set of log messages can be used to verify the completeness of transactions. Furthermore, it is ensured that the contained externally provided data was signed at a certain time (and has not been altered since) and that the signature creation happened in succession to a signature creation over data containing a smaller signature counter value.

### 3.7.1 Creation of transaction logs

Every transaction SHALL be started and finished by calling the corresponding API functions. Additionally, every transaction MAY be updated between start and finish.

#### 3.7.1.1 Start of a transaction

The result of a started transaction SHALL be a log message. The structure of this log message SHALL follow the definitions in chapter 3.7.2. All externally provided process data SHALL be contained in the log message.

A transaction SHALL only be considered 'open' or 'started' if the execution if the functionality to start a transaction executed successfully and without errors.

### 3.7.1.2 Update of a transaction

During the first execution of the transaction update, the process data SHALL be managed by the Secure Element. On every subsequent call the passed process data SHALL be added to the value of concatenated process data from previous calls of the function to update the transaction.

Note: The process data already signed by the transaction start log message are not included in the update process data. The same holds true for additional external data (if present).

Text 14 shows the concatenation of process data during a transaction update (without log message creation in between):

Text 14 Concatenation of process data in the context of a transaction update

Due to the limited memory capacity of some Secure Elements, the process data passed with every update MAY already be fed into the hash function of the signature algorithm. After this, the Secure Element can discard the passed process data from its internal memory. Only the hash function of the signature algorithm SHALL be used for this. The signature hash function SHALL remain open to add additional data in subsequent updates. The hash function SHALL be closed and a signed update log SHALL be created before the finish of the transaction.

If necessary, the Secure Element MAY sign not yet secured process data and additional external data received during the update process. In this case, the signature SHALL be calculated over alldata that has been received so far and that has not yet been secured.

#### 3.7.1.3 Log message signature creation with signed updates

Due to limited capacities of a Secure Element, it might be required to not only create log messages for the start, end of the update phase, and finish of a transaction, but also for every process data update. By implementing this technique, no intermediate data needs to be stored on the Secure Element, as every input is directly signed. The result of a signed update of a transaction SHALL be a log message. The structure of this log message SHALL follow the definitions from chapter 3.7.2.

#### 3.7.1.4 Finish of a transaction

If process data from the update phase has not been protected yet by an update log message, the unprotected process data of the update phase MUST fed into and protected by an update log message.

The result of a finished transaction SHALL be a log message. The structure of this log message SHALL follow the definitions in chapter 3.7.2. All externally provided process data and additional external data (if present) passed with the finish transaction function call SHALL be contained in the log message.

#### 3.7.1.5 Abandoned transactions

The device MAY concider a started and not finished transaction 'abandoned' when it is not to be expected that the started transaction will be finished e.g. a "very long" time passed since the last start or update of the transaction. This guideline does not state any criteria for the classification of a transaction with the status 'abandoned'. If not further declared by a referencing guideline, the classification is up to the device manufacturer.

#### 3.7.2 Transaction log format

Transaction logs are, as well as system logs, derived from the common log message structure defined in chapter 2.1.1. For transaction logs the placeholder certifiedData is replaced with transaction specific elements:

- 1. An element which indicates the start, update or the end of the recording of the externally provided data (operationType)
- 2. An element which logs the ID of the external client which feeds information into the logging device (clientId)
- 3. An element containing the raw data that has been fed into the device to be protected (processData)
- 4. An element describing the type of external process that is protected by this log message (processType)
- 5. An element for additional data to be fed into the protection (additionalExternalData)11
- 6. An element with a unique transaction number (transactionNumber)
- 7. An element where the device can add device internal data into the log (additionalInternalData).12

Additional elements MUST NOT be present.

#### 3.7.2.3 Indefinite length encoding of process data

The length encoding of the element processData in transaction logs is CONDITIONAL.

- If the process data is transmitted to the Secure Element in more than one step (cf. section 3.7.1.2 for details), indefinite length encoding according to [X690], MAY be used. This has the advantage that the length of the process data being signed needs not to be known in advance of the signature generation process. Note that each individual processData element inside the indefinite length encoding MUST be encoded using definite length encoding.
- Otherwise, definite length encoding according to [X690] MUST be used.

The following Text 15 shows an example of indefinite length encoding for process data. The characters "LL" are thereby used as a placeholder for the definite length encoding of the following process data according to [X690].

## A2 80 04 LL processData(1) 04 LL processData(2) … 04 LL processData(n) 00 00

Table 68 Transaction log elements – startTransaction

#### 3.7.5.4 startTransaction – Exceptions

The following exceptions can occur when calling the function startTransaction:

- ErrorCertificateExpired
- ErrorClientNotRegistered
- ErrorDeviceNotInitialized
- ErrorFunctionFailed
- ErrorFunctionNotSupported
- ErrorInvalidClientIdCharacter
- ErrorLimitOfSimultaneousOpenTransactionsReached
- ErrorParameterSyntax
- ErrorParameterTooLong
- ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed
- ErrorSecureElementDisabled
- ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected
- ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow
- ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted
- ErrorSigningEventDataFailed
- ErrorStorageMediumDisconnected
- ErrorStorageMemoryFull
- ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed
- ErrorTimeNotSet
- ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted
- ErrorTransactionCounterOverflow
- ErrorTransactionLoggingLocked
- ErrorUserNotAuthenticated
- ErrorUserNotAuthorized

#### 3.7.5.5 startTransaction – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behaviour of the startTransaction function in detail:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 4. If the function lockTransactionLogging is implemented, the function SHALL check if transaction logging is currently locked. If transaction logging is locked, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionLoggingLocked and exit the function.
- 5. If the the maximum number of simultaneously open transactions that can be managed by the device is limited and the limit has been reached, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorLimitOfSimultaneousOpenTransactionsReached and exit the function.
- 6. If the function registerClient is not implemented, the function SHALL check if the passed clientId consists only of valid characters. If the passed clientId contains invalid characters, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorInvalidClientIdCharacter and exit the function.
- 7. If the function registerClient is implemented, the function SHALL check if the ID passed as parameter clientId is registered using the function registerClient. If the ID is not registered, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorClientNotRegistered and exit the function.
- 8. If the Secure Element consists of multiple logical or physical parts that need to be connected in order to perform the whole function startTransaction without errors the function shall check that the needed parts are connected. If one or more of the mandatory connections is lost, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected and exit the function.
- 9. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to start a transaction and SHALL pass all data that is to be secured, and not created or determined by Secure Element itself, to the Secure Element. In this step, the Secure Element will generate a transaction number for the transaction. If the execution fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 10. Next, the function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element from it. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 11. The data sent to the Secure Element and the data of the log message parts retrieved from the Secure Element (together forming the log message contents) SHALL be stored. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 12. After the data has been stored successfully, the function SHALL return the current transaction number (as an output parameter) by transactionNumber, the current signature counter by signatureCounter, the time of the log message creation by signatureCreationTime, the hash value over the used public key by serialNumber and the created signature value by signatureValue. Additionally, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function startTransaction has been successful.

#### 3.7.6.5 updateTransaction – Detailed description

The following description specifies the two permitted variants of the updateTransaction function behaviour in detail:

Variant A: The device always immediately creates a transaction log message to secure and save the externally provided data:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 4. If the function lockTransactionLogging is implemented, the function SHALL check if transaction logging is currently locked. If transaction logging is locked, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionLoggingLocked and exit the function.
- 5. If the function registerClient is not implemented, the function SHALL check if the passed clientId consists only of valid characters. If the passed clientId contains invalid characters, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorInvalidClientIdCharacter and exit the function.
- 6. If the function registerClient is implemented, the function SHALL check if the ID passed as parameter clientId is registered using the function registerClient. If the ID is not registered, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorClientNotRegistered and exit the function.
- 7. The Secure Element SHALL check whether the transactionNumber belongs to an open transaction. If this is not the case, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionNumberNotFound and exit the function.
- 8. If the Secure Element consists of multiple logical or physical parts that need to be connected in order to perform the whole function updateTransaction without errors the function shall check that the needed parts are connected. If one or more of the mandatory connections is lost, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected and exit the function.
- 9. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to update a transaction and SHALL pass all data that is to be secured, and not created or determined by Secure Element itself, to the Secure Element. If the execution fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 10. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element from it. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 11. The data sent to the Secure Element and the data of the log message parts retrieved from the Secure Element (together forming the log message contents) SHALL be stored. If the data has not been

stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.

12. After the data has been stored successfully, the function SHALL return the type of performed protection on the data by performedUpdateProtection with a value of noPrevPassedProtected, the time of the log message creation by firstLogsignatureCreationTime, the signature counter by firstLogsignatureCounter and the signature value by firstLogsignatureValue. Additionally, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function updateTransaction has been successful.

Variant B: The device collects several updates, keeps the externally provided data in memory, concatenates the data and creates fewer transaction log messages for the updates (Fewer signatures are created and this method might perform better on certain devices):

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 4. If the function lockTransactionLogging is implemented, the function SHALL check if transaction logging is currently locked. If transaction logging is locked, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionLoggingLocked and exit the function.
- 5. If the function registerClient is not implemented, the function SHALL check if the passed clientId consists only of valid characters. If the passed clientId contains invalid characters, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorInvalidClientIdCharacter and exit the function.
- 6. If the function registerClient is implemented, the function SHALL check if the ID passed as parameter clientId is registered using the function registerClient. If the ID is not registered, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorClientNotRegistered and exit the function.
- 7. The Secure Element SHALL check whether the transactionNumber belongs to an open transaction. If this is not the case, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionNumberNotFound and exit the function.
- 8. If the Secure Element consists of multiple logical or physical parts that need to be connected in order to perform the whole function updateTransaction without errors the function shall check that the needed parts are connected. If one or more of the mandatory connections is lost, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected and exit the function.
- 9. If an update of the transaction without log message creation was performed before and the function is invoked with a clientId/processType value that differs from the clientId/processType value of the preceding update, all previously submitted and not yet protected data MUST be directly saved and secured with a transaction log:
	- 1. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the secured parts of a transaction log message for the preceding updates that have not yet been secured. The function SHALL pass all data that is to be secured, and not created or determined by Secure Element itself, including the unprotected update data that has been collected before

the current updateTransaction call to the Secure Element. The passed data SHALL include the "old" clientId and "old" processType. If the execution of the functionality fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed SHALL and exit the function.

- 2. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 3. The input data and the data of the retrieved log message parts (together forming a log message) SHALL be stored on the storage medium. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 10. If the parameter forceSignature contains the value TRUE, the function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to perform a signed update of a transaction (create an update transaction log message):
	- 1. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the secured parts of a transaction log message. The function SHALL pass all data that is to be secured, and not created or determined by Secure Element itself, including the so far collected and unprotected update data, passed with previous and the current updateTransaction call, to the Secure Element. If the execution of the functionality fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
	- 2. Next, the function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element from it. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
	- 3. The data sent to the Secure Element and the data of the log message parts retrieved from the Secure Element (together forming the log message contents) SHALL be stored. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
	- 4. After the data has been stored successfully, the function SHALL return the time of the log message creation, the signature counter and the signature value. If so far only one log messages has been created, the return values firstLogSignatureCreationTime, firstLogSignatureCounter and firstLogSignatureValue SHALL be used to return the log message details. If two log messages have been created, the output parameters firstLogSignatureCreationTime, firstLogSignatureCounter and firstLogSignatureValue SHALL be used to return details for the log message created first in time, the parameters secondLogSignatureCreationTime, secondLogSignatureCounter and secondLogSignatureValue SHALL be used for the log message details of the log message created second. The return value performedUpdateProtection SHALL be used to return the type of protection performed on the data. Additionally, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function updateTransaction has been successful.
- 11. If the parameter forceSignature contains the value FALSE, the function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to update a transaction and store the clientId, processData , processType, additionalExternalData (if present) and the transactionNumber for further updates. If the execution of the function fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUpdateTransactionFailed and exit the function.
- 12. If a log messag has been created in step 7, the output parameters firstLogSignatureCreationTime, firstLogSignatureCounter and firstLogSignatureValue SHALL be used to return the log message details of the created log message. The return value performedUpdateProtection SHALL be used to

return the type of protection performed on the data. The function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function updateTransaction has been successful.

- 13. If no further update is performed after a reasonable amount of time20 after the last update, the function SHALL create a log message with the previously unprotected (unsigned) data21:
	- 1. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to update a transaction and SHALL pass all data that is to be secured, and not created or determined by Secure Element itself, including the previously unprotected (unsigned) data, to the Secure Element. If the execution of the function fails, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
	- 2. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element from it. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
	- 3. The data sent to the Secure Element and the data of the log message parts retrieved from the Secure Element (together forming the log message contents) SHALL be stored. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHOULD raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.

#### 3.7.7.5 finishTransaction – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behaviour of the finishTransaction function in detail:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function.
- 3. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 4. If the function lockTransactionLogging is implemented, the function SHALL check if transaction logging is currently locked. If transaction logging is locked, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionLoggingLocked and exit the function.
- 5. If the function registerClient is not implemented, the function SHALL check if the passed clientId consists only of valid characters. If the passed clientId contains invalid characters, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorInvalidClientIdCharacter and exit the function.
- 6. If the function registerClient is implemented, the function SHALL check if the ID passed as parameter clientId is registered using the function registerClient. If the ID is not registered, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorClientNotRegistered and exit the function.
- 7. The Secure Element SHALL check whether the transactionNumber belongs to an open transaction. If this is not the case, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionNumberNotFound and exit the function.
- 8. If the Secure Element consists of multiple logical or physical parts that need to be connected in order to perform the whole function finishTransaction without errors the function shall check that the needed parts are connected. If one or more of the mandatory connections is lost, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected and exit the function.
- 9. If the transaction was updated using the function updateTransaction and the last update was not signed, the function SHALL perform the tasks defined in chapter 3.7.6.5 "updateTransaction – Detailed description" to log the previously unsigned update.
- 10. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to finish a transaction and to pass the relevant data to the Secure Element. If the execution fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 11. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the execution of this function fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 12. The process data, created since the start or the last signed update of the transaction and the data of the retrieved log message parts SHALL be stored. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 13. The function SHALL return the time of the log message creation, the signature counter and the signature value. If so far only the finishTransaction log message has been created, the return values firstLogSignatureCreationTime, firstLogSignatureCounter and firstLogSignatureValue SHALL be used to return the log message details.

#### 3.7.9.12.3.2 eventData

The event specific element UnlockTransactionLoggingEventData replaces the place holder element "EventSpecificDataPlaceHolder" in the general system-log definition (The tagging is kept as it is defined in the system-log definition).

The element UnlockTransactionLoggingEventData is defined by the following ASN.1 statement:

}

```
UnlockTransactionLoggingEventData ::= SEQUENCE { 
 -- left empty intentionally
```
The sequence is empty.

#### 3.7.9.12.4 unlockTransactionLogging – Exceptions

The following exceptions can occur when calling the function unlockTransactionLogging:

- ErrorCertificateExpired
- ErrorDeviceNotInitialized
- ErrorFunctionFailed
- ErrorFunctionNotSupported
- ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed
- ErrorSecureElementDisabled
- ErrorSecureElementPartsDisconnected
- ErrorSignatureCounterOverflow
- ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted

- ErrorStorageMediumDisconnected
- ErrorStorageMemoryFull
- ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed
- ErrorTimeNotSet
- ErrorTransactionLoggingNotLocked
- ErrorUnlockTransactionLoggingFailed
- ErrorUserNotAuthenticated
- ErrorUserNotAuthorized

#### 3.7.9.12.5 unlockTransactionLogging – Detailed description

The following description specifies the behavior of the function unlockTransactionLogging in detail:

- 1. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality solely to authenticated users, the function SHALL check if the user that has invoked the function has the status authenticated. If the status is not authenticated, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthenticated and exit the function.
- 2. If the referencing guideline limits the access to the functionality to certain roles, the function SHALL check in the corresponding role if the (unauthenticated) user is authorized to execute the function. If the user is not authorized, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUserNotAuthorized and exit the function. The function SHOULD provide additional information on the user who locked the transaction logging alongside the exception.
- 3. The function SHALL check if the logging of transactions is currently locked. If transaction logging is not locked, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTransactionLoggingNotLocked and exit the function.
- 4. If the current time in the SE is not set, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorTimeNotSet and exit the function.
- 5. The function SHALL invoke the functionality of the Secure Element to create the log message parts to log the unlocking of transaction logging. If the execution fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorSigningEventDataFailed and exit the function.
- 6. The function SHALL retrieve the parts of the log message determined by the Secure Element. If the retrieval of the log message parts fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRetrieveLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 7. The function SHALL enable the execution of the functions startTransaction, updateTransaction and finishTransaction. If the unlocking of the input functions fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorUnlockTransactionLoggingFailed and exit the function.
- 8. If the unlocking of the input functions has been successful, the data of the retrieved log message parts SHALL be stored. If the data has not been stored successfully, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorStoringLogMessageFailed and exit the function.
- 9. If the data has been stored successfully, the function SHALL return without raising an exception to indicate that the execution of the function unlockTransactionLogging has been successful.

# Appendix B The TAR file format

The TAR file format allows it to combine multiple files into one. It also allows the analysis of the TAR file on all common operating systems (i.e. the TAR file can be easily unpacked and the content can be viewed).

This document references the format specified in [POSIX.1-2001].

A TAR archive consists of a series of file objects. Figure 2 shows that the original information of each file that is contained in the tar archive stays unchanged.

| file header (512 byte) | file data | padding (zeros) | <br>end of archive block 1<br>(512 byte zeros) | end of archive block 2<br>(512 byte zeros) |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|                        |           |                 |                                                |                                            |
|                        |           | tar archive     |                                                | color scheme                               |
|                        |           |                 |                                                | unchanged information                      |
|                        |           |                 |                                                | metadata                                   |

#### Figure 2 TAR file format

Each file object included in the tar archive is preceded by a 512-byte header record. The file data is written unaltered directly following the header, but is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes (denoted as padding in Figure 2). As most modern implementations use a padding of zeros, implementations following this document SHALL also use zeros for this padding.

The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records of 512 byte. The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.

The TAR format according to [POSIX.1-2001] extends the [POSIX.1-1988] format by allowing arbitrary attributes to be stored as special archive members before the actual file entry. This provides for unlimited length path names, file sizes, unlimited precision timestamps, etc.

The TAR standard as defined in [POSIX.1-2001] allows certain options for the headers that are explained and restricted in this chapter as follows:

- 1. In addition to entries describing archive members, an archive MAY contain entries which TAR itself uses to store information. The implementation MAY use such entries but their use is not mandatory.
- 2. The file header of each file in the TAR file SHALL conform to [POSIX.1-2001] with restrictions as explained in Table 94. Entries not contained in Table 94 SHALL conform to [POSIX.1-2001] without further restrictions.
- 3. All characters in the header logical record SHALL be represented by ASCII characters that are contained in the coded character set of [ISO646] (cf. [OpenGroup2004]).

The extended header which is defined in [POSIX.1-2001] SHALL NOT contain other keywords than atime, mtime and path. The value following the keyword "path" SHALL consist of characters from the character set shown in Appendix A.

# Appendix D DER encoding introduction - informative

This section aims to provide a short introduction to the Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) DER encoding format.

For further and binding information regarding ASN.1, please refer to the official specifications [X680] and [X690]. For an intermediate introduction, information wise situated between the official standard and this paragraph, one might want to have a look at the web page "A Layman's Guide to a Subset of ASN.1, BER, and DER" [LAYMAN].

ASN.1 is an abstract language that allows users to define a variety of data types and encode data in a manner that can easily be parsed given the underlying definition of the data structure. It relies on the notation of tag (payload identifier), length (payload length), and value (payload value) and therefore creates so-called TLVobjects.

ASN.1 subdivides its messages into chunks of eight bits. Instead of calling those 'byte', ASN.1 calls them 'octet'.

A TLV object can be described as follows:

- Tag: similar to keywords like "int", "bool" or "char" in common programming languages the tag indicates which kind of data to expect inside the current TLV object. There are standardized ("universal class") and custom tags.
- Length: this field indicates the length of the value element (the payload) of this TLV-object.
- Value: the data (payload).

ASN.1 offers several encoding rulesets. This Technical Guideline uses the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) ruleset. In ASN.1 DER, there is no ambiguity on how to encode and decode data, thus leaving only one correct way for encoding.

Listed below are some examples for encoding data:

| Element | Element value                       | Encoding (Hex) | Meaning                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tag     | OCTET STRING<br>(universal class 4) | 04             | The data in the payload is of type OCTET<br>STRING (a "byte array"). The type OCTET<br>STRING is encoded by the universal class<br>number 4. |
| Length  | 2                                   | 02             | The payload is two bytes long                                                                                                                |
| Value   | EFAC                                | EFAC           | Payload are the two bytes 0xEF and 0xAC                                                                                                      |
