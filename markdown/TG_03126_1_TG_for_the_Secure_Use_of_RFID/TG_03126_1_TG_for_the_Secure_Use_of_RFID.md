# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**1 Description of the application area for "eTicketing in public transport"**

In order to use public transport a passenger requires an entitlement, otherwise known as a ticket. This entitlement is traditionally in the form of a paper ticket, to which the passenger gives validity (stamps, validates) when issued or when the journey begins, and which may be checked by a controller in the vehicle or on the platform.

In Germany, access barriers in railway stations were dismantled at the end of the 1950s for reasons of cost, whereas in many other parts of the world electro-mechanical access equipment has been introduced. There you can only access the platform via access barriers which evaluate an entitlement. Simple techniques were used at first such as tokens (e.g. New York) and magnetic stripe cards (Singapore, London). Nowadays many of these initial implementations have been replaced by contact-less proximity chip technology. Other important references have emerged such as Peking, Seoul, Moscow, Paris, Warsaw and Oslo. The contactless chip technology defined in ISO/IEC14443 has proved the most reliable, powerful and cost-efficient solution for mass applications in public transport, and the worldwide acceptance of the ISO/IEC14443 standard is mainly a result of the positive experience gleaned from these projects.

Currently, almost all large-scale international implementations utilise relatively inexpensive chip cards with contact-less memory chips. Many of these projects are the sole responsibility of a single transport company. If more than one transport company is involved then there is a contractually regulated relationship between the providers, and on that basis there is an organisational collaboration governing in detail themes such as products, fares and clearing.

In Germany the situation is somewhat different at the moment. There is no implementation yet that is using electro-mechanical access barriers in stations.

Furthermore, approximately 360 public and 4,500 private transport companies are active in Germany. There are no heavily used areas of transport that are served by just one single transport company. Since the *VerkehrsverbÃ¼nde*, or regional transport associations, were introduced in the 1970s, the general situation for most passengers is that they draw on the services of several companies using just one single interoperable entitlement. This implies the need to remunerate the companies fairly for the transport they provide â a process known as "Clearing".

For passengers, this mixed service situation comes with difficulties that hinder the use of public transport. Every regional transport association has a different, complex fare system and its own tickets. With the exception of certain long-distance train tickets, it is impossible to book a journey that includes local public transport on one single ticket. Instead passengers usually have to get to grips with complex fare systems and unfamiliar automatic ticket machines when they arrive.

It was against this background that the *Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen* (VDV, or Association of German Transport Companies) began to develop an IFM (Interoperable Electronic Fare Management System) based on contact-less chip technology and known as the VDV Core Application (CA). This has become the standard in Germany for interoperable electronic fare management. The CA pursues the following aims:

- 1 Improve the attractiveness of public transport for the customer by introducing the following features and services:
	- a Introduce an interoperable customer medium throughout Germany which customers can use with every transport company and association provided it operates CA-compliant systems.
- b Automatic fare calculation that takes into account the transport services used.
- 2 Strengthen transport companies by:
	- a Counteracting counterfeit fraud.
	- b Helping to divide up takings among the companies.
	- c Increasing competition: create an interoperable service platform offering the companies flexibility in their fare policies.

The first implementation of the CA is beginning to be put into place. Media using the interface defined in ISO/IEC14443 are being used.

European standardisation authorities have so far introduced three standards to support the emerging IFM system:

- 1 The functional system architecture and the application scenarios of IFM systems are described in the standard ISO EN 24014-1. This standard was drawn up by the CEN TC 278 WG3 SG5 Work Group.
- 2 The description of the data elements to be used in the medium, and the structure of the data elements (application), are contained in CEN TC 224 WG11 SG1.
- 3 The EN 1545 standard describes the data elements and EN 15320 describes the data structuring (IOPTA, InterOperable Public Transport Application).

The VDV Core Application implements the existing international system standards into one overall set of technical system specifications.

This is to be the basis for our discussions henceforth.

# <span id="page-13-1"></span><span id="page-13-0"></span>**2 Description of services, products and carrier media**

This discussion of products and carrier media intends initially â as also does IOPTA â to delineate the current and predicted state of affairs in Europe. However, emphasis will be placed on the check-in/check-out variation of the CA (CICO), since this is the most highly developed, powerful and flexible of the IOPTA application scenarios. In a CICO-system, the passenger actively registers to the systems at the start and at the end of the journey by using his electronic customer media.

Customers are provided with services by transport companies, and the following ticketing products are offered in that connection:

- 1 Electronic ticket (individual ticket, day, month, year and network tickets with defined regional validity, and tickets for regional and long-distance travel).
- 2 Multi-journey entitlements.
- 3 Upgrading with additional entitlements.
- 4 Unceasing tickets (automatic fare calculation, CICO, electronic ticket subscription contract).

The products differ in terms of particular features and characteristics:

- 1 Interoperable or non-interoperable usage.
- 2 Value of entitlement:
	- E-ticket approx. â¬1 â¬15,000; e.g. VRR: â¬6,000, DB AG: â¬15,000,
	- Stored value â¦ â¬150
	- Unceasing or season tickets â¦ >â¬1,000
- 3 Non-transferable personalised, transferable personalised, anonymous.
- 4 Validity in terms of time and region / non-regulated entitlements.
- 5 Charging variations (account entitlements {pre-/postpaid}, credit entitlements, â¦)
- 6 Time of fare calculation (pre-pricing, trip-pricing and post-pricing).

In all this, interoperability is defined as when two or more companies accept an entitlement/product (acceptance terminal interfaces have to be standardised; in the VDV CA this means ISO-14443 and the specified data interfaces) and calculate between themselves which services were used and how the takings are shared out. Every transport company association in Germany now operates like this. From the customer's point of view interoperability means that they can use their media and entitlements to travel with different service providers.

Automatic fare calculation requires a check-in at the start of the journey and a check-out at the end, and this in turn requires CICO (check-in/check-out) infrastructure. Systems that use access barriers can use these for checking in and out. In systems without access barriers (Germany for example), a CICO infrastructure comprising check-in and check-out terminals must be installed on the platforms and in the vehicles.

The following carrier media are generally considered for use in public transport:

- 1 Paper ticket
- 2 Magnetic stripe card
- 3 Smart Ticket with contact-less proximity interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443
- 4 Contact-less chip card with proximity interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443
- 5 Contact-less, high-security multi-application card with proximity interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443

The products are sold through the following channels:

- 1 Direct sales by the product provider:
	- a Customer centre, vending machine, local sales point e.g. at a railway station
	- b Internet sales
- 2 Sales through retailers:
	- a Travel agencies, hotels, etc.
	- b Internet sales

**Table 2â1 Overview of sales channels and their features** 

"+" indicates that the feature applies to the respective sales channel

"â" indicates that the relation has not to be considered

"+" a symbol highlighted in grey denotes developments expected in the future

1 Sale by personnel

Sales through customer centres, local sales points, guards and drivers involve a direct interaction between the customer and the personnel of the product provider (CCP). What these sales channels have in common is that the personnel can identify the customer (e.g. by checking the customer's identity card) and that several payment methods etc. may be used in a flexible way.

Differences arise from the various technical possibilities.

Customer media can only be initialised if there is online access to the relevant background systems and if the necessary equipment is available on site. At the moment this is not always the case. Customer media are often ordered at customer centres and sales points and then delivered by post. Alternatively, the finished medium can be kept for collection at the customer centre. This process cannot take place with mobile sales (i.e. in vehicles), since customer accounts cannot be set up due to time constraints or lacking connection to the required systems.

In the future there will be methods for loading applications and personalising in customer centres and also via the Internet using home readers, and over-the-air using NFC mobile devices.

Loading entitlements onto existing personalised and non-personalised media requires direct communication between the customer medium and the sales system via a suitable

reader. This is currently supported in customer centres and local sales points for personalised and non-personalised products. Non-personalised products can also be sold offline using Secure Authentication Modules (SAMs). This is also possible when the reader is offline (e.g. in vehicles or in other places where no online-connection is available).

### 2 Static and mobile vending machines

Vending machines are nowadays very widespread. There are static installations in railway stations or at bus stops, or readers that are implemented in vehicles.

Static vending machines can be connected to sales and management systems via an online link. This means that vending machines could even be used to initialise and personalise customer media. In contrary to that, continuous online links do not exist in vehicles.

At the moment customers do not have the option of registering at vending machines, since a reliable means of identification does not exist. This also means that customer accounts cannot be set up, and personalised media cannot be applied for.

That is why vending machines only sell products anonymously at present. Loading entitlements onto existing customer media is technically possible if the vending machine is equipped with an appropriate reader with SAM.

Soon customers will be able to enjoy secure, convenient methods of identification and authentication using â for example â electronic identity cards. This can also enable registering at vending machines.

3 Internet

The customer submits personal details, the order, and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (web page). The availability of the product and, where applicable, seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering on the Internet. Payment is by credit card, direct debit, or similar. Products and customer media are delivered by post or can be made available for collection at a customer centre.

Personal and address information submitted through a web page is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves considerable extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

4 Internet using card-readers / over-the-air and possibly secure proof of identity (e.g. eID) In future there may be another way in which customers can register and place orders.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (web page). Data relating to the customer's person (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and a secure identity card (electronic identity card, eID).

The availability of the product and, where applicable, seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering on the Internet. Payment is by credit card, direct debit, or similar. Products and customer media are delivered by post or can be made available for collection (sales point, vending machine).

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID are to be considered trustworthy and reliable. Additional checking is not required.

Anonymous use of public transport can also be offered via this sales channel, in which case an anonymous medium is used and a non-personalised entitlement loaded onto it. The service is paid for by means of credits stored on the medium. These credits can be purchased through the sales infrastructure using anonymous payment methods.

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**3 Agreements**

## **3.1 Definition of terms**

#### Application area

the area in which the Technical Guidelines are intended to apply; the highest unit in the terminological structure; incorporates one or more applications, the products/services that belong to those applications and the application scenarios that result from that

#### Application scenario

a particular way of looking at the application area in terms of the implementation of specific products and services

#### Operating process

a comprehensive operational procedure in an application area like eTicketing; examples are the sales process, the use of an entitlement, clearing, and so on

#### Use case

detailed description of a series of activities that constitute part of an operating process; examples include initialising a carrier medium and loading an entitlement

#### Check-in / check-out (CICO)

when using the "automatic fare calculation" product, the passenger must check in at the start of the journey and check out at the end. This requires an appropriate infrastructure, known as a CICO infrastructure. Systems that use access barriers can use these for checking in and out. Otherwise a CICO infrastructure comprising check-in and check-out terminals (CICO terminals) must be installed on the platforms, at bus stops and in vehicles.

### Interoperability

Interoperability means that the customer can redeem his entitlement with more than one service provider. The service provider is remunerated for the services provided by the product owner. Interoperability is required between transport company associations and also between transport companies within such associations. Accounting accuracy is a central aspect of this, since it determines the money received by the service providers. In the past, money was shared out within transport company associations on the basis of traffic flow analyses, statistics and estimates. Technical accounting accuracy can be achieved with the introduction of CICO technology.

#### Usage data

the calculation process in the "automatic fare calculation" product is based on data gathered when the customer uses the service. To enable this, the customer checks in at a terminal using his customer medium and then checks out again when he has finished using the service. The usage data acquired is stored in the terminal and the customer medium. Its reliability is fundamental to the reliable invoicing of customers and to interoperability between service providers.

#### Calculation data

the usage data which is used for accounting purposes is referred to as calculation data. Calculation data contains, for example, information about the entitlement, the product owner, the service provider, and the place and time of check-in <span id="page-18-0"></span>and check-out. This data may or may not be able to be assigned to the customer, depending on whether personalised or anonymous entitlement is being used. The calculation data is passed on to the product owner by the service provider, who gathers it at the CICO terminals. The authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the calculation data are extremely important to customers and service providers alike.

Statistical data

Statistical data provides information about the general use of a product, a line, a vehicle and so on. With an "automatic fare calculation" entitlement, the statistical data can be derived from the usage data. With other products, usage data can be gathered when the entitlement is assessed before entry. Statistical data is stored and utilised in an anonymised and statistically processed form. Statistical data is not used for invoicing customers for services, but rather for the service provider's or product owner's planning purposes, which is why it is only held in anonymised form. Statistical data can, however, be used for a general division of takings between service providers.

## <span id="page-18-1"></span>**3.2 Generic modelling of roles and entities**

The roles and responsibilities shall be described on the basis of the ISO 24014 standard.

![](_page_18_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### **Figure 3â1 Entities in an application area as defined by ISO 24014 (but extended to include customer medium entities)**

ISO 24014 defines entities and assigns roles and responsibilities to them. The implementation for the eTicketing areas of use is described in the following:

Actor

An entity that operates in accord with the role assigned to it.

Customer

The purchaser of a product and user of the services associated with it. The customer pays money and receives from the product provider an entitlement to use services. This entitlement is redeemed at the service provider.

#### Customer medium

The customer medium is a data carrier in which an electronic entitlement can be stored. The customer medium is held by the customer, and is required by the customer in order to use the entitlement. Other common names for the customer medium are user medium and carrier medium. Examples of customer media include Smart Tickets, chip cards and NFC mobile devices.

#### Issuer of customer medium

The issuer of the customer medium configures it for further use. The issuer may market the customer medium through customer media providers (such as transport companies). Close coordination and a contractual relationship are required between the issuer of the customer medium, the application issuer and the system manager.

#### Provider of customer medium

The provider of the customer medium (e.g. a transport company or mobile phone service provider) markets the customer medium which it has received from the customer medium issuer. The provider of the customer medium normally implements with the issuing of the customer medium.

#### Application

The application supports one or more products by providing functions and structures â such as those needed to store entitlements on the carrier medium, in the sales system and in the backend system. The implementation follows the application specification, which normally belongs to the issuer of the application. The issuer of the application may market the application through application providers (such as a regional transport association). As well as the products, the application may also contain customer-specific information.

#### Application issuer

The application issuer is the owner of the application specification. The application issuer may market the application through application providers (e.g. a transport company).

#### Application provider

The application provider (e.g. a transport company or stadium operator) implements and markets the application which it has received from an application issuer (e.g. in licensed form). The application provider also normally issues the carrier medium in conjunction with implementing the application, making him, for instance, the contractual partner to the customer in the eTicketing application area.

#### Product/entitlement/service

The product is a service or object provided by a product owner and which the customer can use in return for payment. The product belongs to the product owner (e.g. a concert organiser) and is offered to customers directly or through a product provider (e.g. travel agent or advance ticket office). When he purchases the product, the customer receives an entitlement to use a service, which he can then redeem at the service provider (e.g. transport company).

#### Product owner

The owner of the product (e.g. a single entry to a Bundesliga football match). The product owner defines and markets the product, sometimes through a product provider (e.g. an advance ticket office). In simple scenarios, however, it is quite normal for the product owner to be the product provider as well. The product owner must follow the specifications of the application issuer when he defines his product, in order to ensure that the application can support the product. Furthermore, close collaboration is required between the product owner and the service provider who is to provide the service promised by the product. A contractual relationship is required between the product owner, product provider and service provider.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>Product provider

Markets the product on behalf of the product owner in return for a fee. The product provider receives the customer's payment and is therefore the only interface for payments. This demands direct coordination and a contractual relationship with the product owner. The product provider places the product (e.g. an entitlement) into the application on the carrier medium. The product provider is the contractual partner to the customer in terms of the entitlements he has purchased to utilise services. In organisational terms the product owner often takes on the role of product provider as well.

#### Service provider

Examples include stadium operators and public transport service operators. Provides the customer with a service if he presents an entitlement purchased from a product provider (e.g. entry to a stadium). This requires direct coordination and a contractual relationship between the product provider and product owner.

#### System manager

The system manager ensures that the rules of the system are upheld. To this end he draws on the functional entities of security manager and registrar.

#### Registrar

The registrar ensures that unique identifying characteristics are allocated throughout the system. This is necessary in order to clearly identify the entities, carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

#### Security manager

Establishes and coordinates the security regulations in the system. Responsible for approving the components of the system. Monitors the performance of security-related functions (e.g. key management).

### <span id="page-20-1"></span>**3.3 Allocation of roles and entities in the "eTicketing for public transport" application area**

Making the services available which are described in Chapter [2](#page-13-1) demands, in a fully developed configuration, the interaction of diverse and changing entities. For instance, it must be made possible for a service provider to handle products from various different product owners and providers, and to support the invoicing accordingly.

The assignment of entities in this application area is identical to the generic description in section [3.2](#page-18-1). In the following diagram, the main entities defined in the VDV Core Application are also shown to provide an example:

<span id="page-21-0"></span>![](_page_21_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

<span id="page-21-1"></span>The specifications of the VDV Core Application combine some of the roles together:

- 1 The customer contract partner (CCP) takes on the role of providing the customer medium, application and product.
- 2 VDV KA GmbH takes on the roles of system manager (including security manager and registrar) and application issuer.

Given these facts, the generic diagram in [Figure 3â2](#page-21-1) is modified to produce the following specific plan:

![](_page_21_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 3â3 Entities in the "VDV Core Application" application scenario** 

## **3.4 Relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements**

The model described in sections [3.2](#page-18-1) and [3.3](#page-20-1) supports several product providers, service providers, application issuers and so on.

This means that a large number of different carrier media, applications and products would be conceivable.

<span id="page-22-0"></span>The customer or carrier medium is the customer's data carrier on which he stores his entitlements and with the help of which he makes use of the associated services.

Applications provide the structures and functions required to load entitlements onto carrier media, and to make use of the entitlements. The implementation of applications must therefore take account of the features of specific carrier media and entitlements.

The customer can exchange entitlements for services at the service provider.

The following rules apply to the relationships between carrier media, applications and entitlements:

- 1 A carrier medium can contain at least one application. If more than one application can be stored on it, then it is referred to as a multi-application-compatible carrier medium.
- 2 An application can store at least one entitlement. The VDV Core Application simultaneously supports different entitlements of different types, which may originate from different product providers. Personal data and check-in / check-out data may also be stored in the application.
- 3 Applications on one carrier medium can originate from different application issuers and providers.
- 4 Entitlements in one application may originate from different product owners and providers.
- 5 Entitlements of the same type can be stored in different applications.

The following diagram illustrates an example of the relationship between carrier media, applications and entitlements.

![](_page_22_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 3â4 Carrier media, applications and entitlements** 

# <span id="page-23-1"></span><span id="page-23-0"></span>**4 General requirements**

The requirements which must be met by the system as a whole and its processes and components can be divided into three categories.

## **4.1 Function**

### **4.1.1 Customer requirements**

Below are some of the features which are required from the customer's point of view:

- The customer media and systems must be easy to use.
- The customer medium must be durable and reliable, and must perform at a the required speed.
- The entitlement and the customer medium must be easy and reliable to use, including with different service providers.
- The way the "automatic fare calculation" product is invoiced must be reliable and easy to follow.
- It should be possible to replace lost entitlements for an administration fee. The same should apply to exchanging entitlements.
- It must also be possible to purchase anonymous entitlements.
- Reasonable protection must be provided for personal data (where applicable).

Whenever contact-less chip technology is used, the customer should always be kept properly informed of the personal data used, how it is employed, what is done to protect the data, and any risks that remain.

### **4.1.2 Requirements of the product provider and service provider**

Functionality

- It should be easy to explain to customers and personnel how the customer medium and systems are used.
- The way the system components and processes are executed must take into account the conditions particular to public transport. For example, permanent data access to the overall system cannot be guaranteed in vehicles, so it has to be possible to purchase entitlements, redeem them, check-in / check-out and monitor entitlements even when the terminals involved are not online.
- It must be possible to block personalised entitlements and customer media, and to issue replacements.
- Access barriers and check-in/check-out systems must allow enough people through in a given period. A typical requirement for permanently installed systems is a processing time of 300 ms.

Technical compatibility

â¢ The compatibility of system components must be assured even if carrier media, systems and components come from different manufacturers and providers and are used for different service providers.

For an eTicketing system to be operated economically, the commercial benefit must be greater than the cost of the processes, systems and security, regardless of how extensively the system is installed. This must apply to all of the entities who invest in the setting-up of the system.

The system as a whole, and its components, should be designed such that the requirements of the relevant application scenarios are met as efficiently as possible. For this reason it is necessary to define these requirements as accurately as possible to begin with.

# **4.3 Security**

This document will deal with the requirements of security separately, from section [8.2](#page-53-1) onwards.

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**5 Method of determining security requirements**

## **5.1 Objectives**

The Technical Guideline on secure use of RFID should fulfil the following objectives:

- Provide system suppliers and system users with an introductory guide on the correct implementation of specific RFID system solutions, in terms of safety, information security and privacy.
- Raise awareness of and achieve transparency in aspects of security.
- Provide a basis for the system supplier's or operator's declaration of conformity, and for the issuing of quality seals by certification authorities.

The following information is required in order to achieve these aims:

- A definition of the security requirements that must be fulfilled by an RFID system for a given application area.
- A description of the specific risks, appropriate counter-measures, and potential remaining risks, in following called residual risks.
- A definition of the criteria for a declaration of conformity and for certification.

It is not just security aspects that are relevant to the definition of activities and proposed systems; all of the requirements described in Chapter [4](#page-23-1) also have to be taken into consideration.

## **5.2 Method**

### **5.2.1 Scope of system considerations**

RFID-based systems can be very complex. In most cases, a lot of IT components that have no direct relation to RFID are part of the system solution. On the other hand it is not sufficient to look only at the media/tag and reader in order to safeguard the system's security.

The Technical Guidelines must consider every aspect of security in detail that is relevant to RFID. These aspects depend heavily on the application area and the relative implementation of the system solution. These Technical Guidelines therefore contain detailed descriptions of the application area, and the related operations processes (including, for example, sales channels and processes). Based on this information, use cases are identified that are relevant to RFID. Processes and use cases cover the entire life-cycle of RFID media or RFID tags. These use cases are then used as a basis for the identification of threats, and for a detailed system-specific security assessment of RFID-related parts of the system. [Figure 5â1](#page-26-1) shows this approach for the example of eTicketing in public transport.

<span id="page-26-0"></span>![](_page_26_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 5â1 Example: Identification of RFID-relevant use cases for eTicketing** 

<span id="page-26-1"></span>All the other system components are considered only in a fairly general manner. Proposed safeguards follow open standards of IT security.

This concept helps to focus on those parts of the system that are relevant to RFID, and makes sure that all aspects of security are considered. On the other hand the Technical Guidelines leave room for individual and proprietary IT implementations (back-offices, sales systems, logistic systems and so on), which supports the enhancement of existing systems using RFID technology.

## **5.2.2 Scalability and flexibility**

The Technical Guidelines have to address security issues. At the same time, any system based on these Guidelines must be economically viable. This means that the following requirements have to be covered by the Guidelines' approach:

- 1 It must be possible to scale systems in such a way that the costs and benefits are balanced. This means in practice that precautionary measures must be proportional to the need for protection. For example: if only low-cost products are used, which require relatively little protection, then precautions should be designed accordingly. This may allow the use of low-cost media, reducing in turn the cost of implementation and operation of the system.
- 2 The application scenarios that have been chosen for the Technical Guidelines cover a wide range, from small to nationwide and even international systems. It is important that the concept discussed in the Guidelines can be used for system solutions of any size and complexity.
- 3 In many cases a system solution can be made economically viable much more easily if you are able to cooperate with other companies. This applies in particular to eTicketing applications, where it can be very beneficial if media already available to customers

<span id="page-27-0"></span>(such as multi-application cards and NFC-enabled phones) can be used for additional applications, products and related services.

The following diagrams provide examples from eTicketing for the cross-system and crossapplication utilisation of customer media and infrastructure.

[Figure 5â2](#page-27-1) shows that various products and application scenarios may have to be supported in one system. Furthermore, these products may be hosted by various types of RFID media.

#### **Figure 5â2 Example of application scenarios and RFID-relevant use cases for eTicketing in public transport**

<span id="page-27-1"></span>[Figure 5â3](#page-27-2) gives an example of a customer medium for eTicketing that supports applications from two areas of use.

![](_page_27_Figure_8.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5â3 Hierarchical concept for media, applications and entitlements in eTicketing**

<span id="page-27-2"></span>The following concept is used in these Technical Guidelines in order to address the aforementioned requirements:

- 1 A feasible role model and the structure of key components (products, applications and media) are defined in chapter 3. These models support a granular and scalable approach.
- 2 The Technical Guidelines offer security plans that also cover combinations of application scenarios and media used on the same infrastructure. This is achieved by itemised security assessments based on the RFID-relevant use cases.
- <span id="page-28-0"></span>3 Areas of use similar to eTicketing that provide opportunities for cross-application partnerships will be addressed by the respective Technical Guidelines with as much communality as possible. The security considerations and precautionary measures in particular will employ the same technical basis.
- 4 A special challenge to system security exists in partnerships across systems and applications. It must be ensured that the security of one system is not undermined by leakages coming from the other. Normally this requires extensive security assessments in both systems.

The Technical Guidelines address this by introducing a scalable and transparent concept for applying precautions to the identified threats, called "protection demand categories". A total of three categories from 1 (normal demand) to 3 (very high demand) are applied. All of the safeguards are divided accordingly into three levels, from normal to advanced protection.

For every individual system implementation, the protection demand category will be defined to begin with, for every security target. These findings will be used to select the appropriate level for the safeguards involved.

This concept provides an easy way to establish secure system cooperation. It remains only to ensure that the protection demand categories of both systems match up.

### **5.2.4 Explanation of the security concept**

The Technical Guidelines contain complete examples of how security considerations should be applied to specific application scenarios. These can be adapted to the requirements and peripheral conditions of the particular system implementation in hand.

[Figure 5â4](#page-29-1) shows the concept for the Security considerations used in all sections of the Technical Guidelines.

![](_page_29_Figure_6.jpeg)

<span id="page-29-1"></span>**Figure 5â4 Concept for security considerations** 

<span id="page-30-0"></span>All considerations are based on the classic definition of security targets that is given in [Figure](#page-30-1)  [5â5](#page-30-1).

# **6.1 Process P1 "registering and ordering"**

### **6.1.1 Setting up a customer account, purchasing personalised customer media and entitlements**

To set up a customer account and purchase a personalised or non-personalised entitlement, the customer applies to the product provider (i.e. the customer contract partner in the VDV Core Application). If the customer does not possess a carrier medium containing a suitable application, then he can purchase one from the product provider[1](#page-31-0) . To facilitate this, the product provider works together with the providers of the application and the customer medium.

Purchasing customer-related entitlements, applications and carrier media requires that the customer registers. To do this the customer provides the necessary personal information (e.g. name, postal address, payment information) and orders the product required.

It is normally up to the product provider to decide which information is required of the customer for the purposes of determining his identity and address and conducting a credit check.

Let us examine the following processes as examples of registering and ordering:

1 Ordering at a customer centre or a local sales point

The customer visits the sales point (e.g. the customer centre of a transport company, a sales point at a railway station or a travel agent), and orders the product. Payment is made there and then. Ideally, the sales point will have direct access to the eTicketing system and will be able to issue products and customer media on site. If not, they are delivered by post. Personal data is only required if a customer-specific product or a product with a CA payment method by direct debit is ordered, or if postal delivery is required.

Where necessary, identity and personal data is checked by proving the identity by means of an identity card.

2 Service centre

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by fax, written application or telephone. The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by telephone. Payment is by credit card, by direct debit, etc. Products and customer media are delivered by post or put aside for collection (sales point, vending machine).

Personal and address information submitted by fax or phone is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

An example of ordering from a service centre using an order form can be seen at: <http://www.kolibricard.de/bestellung.html> .

<sup>1</sup> The case of a customer who only wants to purchase a customer medium with an application, but no product, is considered irrelevant and is not discussed here.

<span id="page-32-0"></span>3 Internet

The customer submits the necessary personal information, the order and the payment information to a service centre by Internet (web page). The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is by credit card, by direct debit, etc. Products and customer media are delivered by post or put aside for collection at a customer centre.

Personal and address information submitted via the Internet is not necessarily considered trustworthy. Checking it reliably involves extra effort. Normally it is checked solely against a current address database, and a credit check is performed.

4 Internet using card-readers and secure proof of identity (e.g. eID)

In future there may be another way for customers to register and place orders.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (web page). Personal data (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and a secure electronic identity card.

The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is by credit card, by direct debit, etc. Products and customer media are delivered by post or put aside for collection (sales point, vending machine).

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID are to be considered trustworthy and reliable. Additional checking is not required.

![](_page_32_Figure_9.jpeg)

The following diagram shows Process P1A, registering and ordering:

**Figure 6â1 Process P1A "registering and ordering"** 

### <span id="page-33-0"></span>**6.1.2 Purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements**

Anonymous sales and the sale of non-personalised products are especially important in public transport. In such cases, customer accounts are not set up. The product is supplied on a specially produced, non-personalised carrier medium or loaded anonymously onto an existing customer card.

The customer must always pay before the product is handed over.

Anonymous sales require that payment is made immediately, that the entitlement is produced immediately, and that the customer can take it away on his existing customer medium.

The following sales channels can be used:

1 Sales point/customer centre, travel agent

The sale of non-personalised tickets at sales points is common practice for paper tickets. In the future, non-personalised customer media will be able to be produced on site and entitlements loaded onto existing customer media. Payment is in cash or by card.

2 Driver / guard

The sale of tickets by drivers and guards is common practice for paper tickets. In the future it will be possible to load entitlements onto existing customer media this way. Payment is in cash or by card.

3 Vending machine

The sale of tickets by vending machines is common practice for paper tickets. Non-personalised customer media can also be produced by vending machines, and entitlements loaded onto existing customer media.

Payment is in cash or by card.

4 Internet using card-readers and secure proof of identity (e.g. eID)

Even when non-personalised carrier media or the ticket is ordered on the Internet and, for instance, delivered by post, the name and address of the customer still has to be submitted to the product provider. An additional option for registering and ordering can be provided to this end.

It will involve the customer submitting the order and payment information to a service centre via the Internet (web page). Personal data (where necessary) will be identified and transmitted online by means of direct communication between the ticket issuer's application server and a secure electronic identity card.

The availability of the product and factors such as seat reservations can normally be dealt with straight away when ordering by Internet. Payment is by credit card, by direct debit, etc. Products and customer media are delivered by post or put aside for collection (sales point, vending machine). The product and carrier medium themselves do not contain any personal data.

The personal and address information received by communicating with the eID are to be considered fundamentally trustworthy and reliable. Additional checking is not required.

<span id="page-34-0"></span>The following diagram shows Process P1B, purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements:

**Figure 6â2 Process P1B "purchasing non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"** 

## <span id="page-34-1"></span>**6.2 Process P2 "producing and delivering products"**

### **6.2.1 Process P2A "producing and delivering personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

Two basic cases are to be considered when describing this process:

- 1 Producing and delivering an entitlement together with a specially produced carrier medium.
- 2 Loading an entitlement onto a customer-related medium already in the possession of the customer (e.g. secure multi-application card, NFC mobile device).

<span id="page-35-0"></span>The following diagram, [Figure 6â3](#page-35-1), shows Process P2A with 4 sub-processes representing the possible ways in which a product may be delivered.

![](_page_35_Figure_2.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6â3 Process P2A "producing and delivering personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

<span id="page-35-1"></span>In Processes P2A.1 to P2A.3, the entitlement ordered is delivered to the customer on a specially produced carrier medium.

In Process P2A.4 it is assumed that the customer already has a suitable customer medium. This may be a secure chip card, a multi-application card or an NFC mobile device.

The customer medium is used in the first instance to identify and authenticate the customer electronically. If the customer medium does not contain a suitable application, then one must be loaded onto it before the entitlement is loaded on.

### **6.2.2 Process P2B "producing and delivering non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

Two basic cases are to be considered when describing this process:

- 1 Producing and delivering an entitlement together with a specially produced carrier medium.
- 2 Loading an entitlement onto a customer-related medium already in the possession of the customer (e.g. secure multi-application card, NFC mobile device).

<span id="page-36-0"></span>The following diagram, [Figure 6â4](#page-36-1), shows Process P2B with 3 sub-processes representing the possible ways in which a product may be delivered.

![](_page_36_Figure_2.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6â4 Process P2B "producing and delivering non-personalised carrier media and entitlements"**

<span id="page-36-1"></span>In Process P2B.1, the entitlement ordered is delivered to the customer on a specially produced carrier medium. Provided data that can be related to a person is clearly separated on the carrier medium and application, a non-personalised entitlement can be loaded onto a personalised carrier medium.

In Process P2B.2 it is assumed that the customer already has a suitable customer medium. This may be a secure chip card, a multi-application card or an NFC mobile device. If the customer medium does not contain a suitable application, then one must be loaded onto it before the entitlement is loaded on.

Process P2B.3 is the same as P2B.2, except that applications cannot be loaded onto the carrier medium. The customer medium must be fully configured to accept the entitlement as a precondition for the customer to use this process.

# **6.3 Process P3 "using an entitlement"**

The customer must have a carrier medium with an approved application and valid entitlement in order to use the transport. The entitlement is redeemed by the customer in exchange for a service.

Depending on the product, the entitlement is activated at the start of the journey, or the customer checks in when he begins the journey and checks out at the end (CICO). The infrastructure required for this is the responsibility of the service provider.

The public transport service provider must first do a number of things so as to guarantee the operation of this function:

- 1 The local inspection infrastructure must be adapted to the accepted applications and entitlements.
- 2 The specific key information for reading the entitlements and writing the usage data must be integrated into the key management system.
- 3 The list of blocked media, applications and entitlements (blacklist) must be transferred from the ticket system into the inspection infrastructure, which requires the approval and installation of a data interface to the service provider's inspection infrastructure (an interface which enables the data to be updated at sensible intervals).

A journey begins by checking in at a static or mobile terminal. Alternatively, it is possible to use mobile inspection units carried in the vehicles by the ticket-checking staff. The terminals should work even if the data connection to the server fails, which means that all terminals have to work offline as well as online (some of them possibly only temporarily).

When beginning the journey, the entitlement has to be checked and validated. If an "automatic fare calculation" product is being used, then the user must also check out at the end of the journey. At both these points, data relating to the fare is stored in the terminal and the carrier medium.

![](_page_38_Figure_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-38-0"></span>The following diagram shows Process P3:

**Figure 6â5 Process P3 "using a CICO entitlement"** 

Fault cases are not dealt with here.

### **6.4 Process P4 "blocking entitlements, applications and carrier media"**

Because of the high level of counterfeit security that can be achieved with correct implementations of chip-based carrier media, it is possible to block entitlements, applications and carrier media securely. This helps the processes of cancelling and exchanging carrier media and entitlements, and enables lost media to be replaced.

The following are possible scenarios:

- 1 Defective carrier media are withdrawn and destroyed. Before issuing a replacement medium it is important to ascertain that a counterfeit has not been presented for replacement, and that a medium has not been declared as defective and submitted.
- 2 In practice, mislaid carrier media can only be blocked and replaced if they are personalised and assigned to a customer account (see registration) with a product provider. If this is the case, then the owner can identify himself to the product provider from which he obtained the medium, and state which carrier medium is to be blocked. The same procedure can be used to cancel entitlements.
- 3 Mislaid personalised carrier media and the entitlements stored on them can be replaced provided that all the entitlements on them have been blocked. It is important to remember that the carrier medium may contain more than one application, and that these may themselves contain entitlements from various product issuers and providers.

# <span id="page-40-1"></span><span id="page-40-0"></span>**7 Use cases**

The following sections contain descriptions of use cases that are relevant as we look further at contact-less chip technology in this application area. These use cases have been derived from the generic operating processes in Chapter [6](#page-31-1).

The descriptions of the use cases are based on an illustrative system architecture which is discussed in more detail in Chapter [10](#page-105-1).

# **7.1 Use case "Identification when registering and ordering"**

The quality of the process of authenticating and identifying the customer is crucial to the reliability of the data upon which Process P1, "Registering and ordering", is based. Process descriptions P1A.1 â P1A.4 can be used for elucidating this. Using a reliable process, such as one involving a secure personalised customer medium or an electronic identification medium (e.g. an eID), will mean an increase in security and functionality.

## <span id="page-40-2"></span>**7.2 Use case "Carrier medium initialisation"**

The "Carrier medium initialisation" use case depicted in [Figure 7â1](#page-41-1) incorporates the following steps:

- 1 Carrier medium initialisation
	- a Default settings relating to function and security
	- b Setting specific keys
	- c Setting an ID which uniquely identifies the carrier medium
- 2 Loading the applications
	- a Loading the software specific to the applications concerned
	- b Allocating the resources of the carrier medium (setting up file systems and so on)
	- c Setting specific keys for each application
- 3 Loading the application-specific data
	- a Loading customer data (where required)
	- b Loading the ID of the application provider

As the stages of initialising the carrier medium progress, the information in the management system for carrier media and applications has to be updated.

The various keys, certificates and so on that are used are generated and fed in by a key management system. This system is the responsibility of the system manager (more precisely the security manager and registrar). If the carrier medium's chip is to generate public keys during initialisation, then these also have to be fed into the key management system.

Carrier medium initialisation normally takes place in a secure environment (e.g. in a mass personaliser or in a vending machine).

# <span id="page-41-2"></span><span id="page-41-1"></span>**7.3 Use case "Application loading"**

The "Application loading" use case shown in [Figure 7â2](#page-42-1) illustrates the procedure for loading an application onto a carrier medium already in the possession of a customer. This may be a contact-less chip card or an NFC mobile device.

There are various possible scenarios for loading a new application onto an existing carrier medium:

- 1 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in a trustworthy environment
- 2 Loading the application via a contact-less interface in an insecure environment. For instance, this may occur when loading an application onto a contact-less chip card via a reader on a home computer or in an advance ticket office.
- 3 Loading an application "over-the-air" onto an NFC mobile device.

<span id="page-42-0"></span>![](_page_42_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â2 Use case "Application loading"** 

# <span id="page-42-2"></span><span id="page-42-1"></span>**7.4 Use case "Entitlement loading"**

As soon as the carrier medium has been initialised and the applications installed, entitlements can be loaded onto the applications.

The sale of a product is directly dependent on this use case being performed securely and in a way which is easy for customers. The use case is therefore an absolutely crucial one for providers and customers alike. All of the sales channels discussed in the descriptions of Processes P2A and P2B (Section [6.2](#page-34-1)) must be taken into consideration when dealing with the "Entitlement loading" use case depicted in [Figure 7â3](#page-43-1).

<span id="page-43-0"></span>![](_page_43_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â3 Use case "Entitlement loading"** 

<span id="page-43-1"></span>A distinction must be made between the loading of entitlements when the carrier medium is first issued and the loading of entitlements later on. The latter can be done via the Internet using a home reader, "over-the-air" onto an NFC mobile device, or locally at a sales point or vending machine.

# **7.5 Use case "Delivery"**

Carrier media that have been initialised and loaded with entitlements must then be passed to the delivery point or the customer as described in P2A.1 and P2A.2.

When delivering, the product provider must also record security-relevant information about the delivery in the ticket system. This includes:

- 1 Addressee,
- 2 ID of carrier media, ID of products,
- 3 Sender,
- 4 Delivery point, special arrangements relating to handing-over,

## **7.6 Use case "Check-in"**

The "Check-in" use case represents the first part of Process P3.2 in detail. The exact way this is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>![](_page_44_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â4 Use case "Check-in"** 

In the event of a fault the customer is referred to a service desk, which normally means visiting a customer centre. There, a defective carrier medium can be exchanged if necessary.

# **7.7 Use case "Check-out"**

The "Check-out" use case represents the second part of Process P3.2 in detail. The exact way this is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

<span id="page-45-0"></span>![](_page_45_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â5 Use case "Check-out"** 

In the event of a fault the customer is referred to a service desk, which normally means visiting a customer centre. There, a defective carrier medium can be exchanged if necessary.

# **7.8 Use case "Entitlement check"**

The "Entitlement check" use case represents the technical process of a ticket inspector checking the customer's entitlement to travel. This technical process is largely identical to the "Check-in" use case. The exact way it is executed depends on the application involved and the data models and algorithms associated with it. The following diagram shows the procedure.

An entitlement check is normally performed using a mobile inspector's terminal loaded with the necessary SAM and blacklists.

<span id="page-46-0"></span>![](_page_46_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â6 Use case "Entitlement check"** 

If a fault occurs, the entitlement is normally checked visually.

## **7.9 Use case "Blocking"**

Carrier media that have been mislaid must be blocked. The same applies to defective media and products, assuming they cannot be withdrawn and destroyed.

The blocking of a medium and/or the entitlement stored on it is a precondition for the issuing of a replacement medium, or for the transfer of an entitlement to a new owner with a different customer medium.

Blocking can only be performed if it is sufficiently certain that the customer requesting it is the rightful owner of the medium or entitlement. That is why customers may only block media or entitlements in either of the following cases:

- 1 The customer's details were stored when purchasing. Blocking is then performed following reliable identification and a legally binding declaration that the customer agrees to the procedure.
- 2 The medium containing the entitlement is presented. Its authenticity can be determined securely.

<span id="page-47-0"></span>As well as customers performing blocks, other entities in the system can apply for blocking. To this end, responsibilities and processes are defined for these entities in the system as a whole.

**Figure 7â7 Use case "Blocking"** 

# **7.10 Use cases "Key management"**

For performance reasons, entitlements on carrier media are usually protected using procedures involving symmetric keys. The security and proper function of the system as a whole is therefore highly dependent on the secure provision and storage of the keys, a job which has to be done by the key management system and the processes assigned to it.

In the following use cases, Secure Authentication Modules (SAMs) are used as secure storage for key information, security mechanisms and diversification algorithms. In principle, other methods may also be feasible.

Carrier medium initialisation and the loading of entitlements require a key management system that recognises the hierarchical relationship between carrier media, applications and products/entitlements.

### <span id="page-48-0"></span>**7.10.1 Key management for the initialisation of carrier media**

[Figure 7â8](#page-48-1) illustrates the use case of key management for the initialisation of carrier media. The keys and procedures defined here are also required for the loading of applications.

**Figure 7â8 Use case "Key management for carrier media"** 

### <span id="page-48-2"></span><span id="page-48-1"></span>**7.10.2 Key management for loading and personalising applications**

In order to secure applications that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the applications.

[Figure 7â9](#page-49-1) shows the corresponding use cases. The key management system for carrier media also has to be available when the application is loaded onto the carrier medium.

<span id="page-49-0"></span>![](_page_49_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â9 Use case "Key management for applications"** 

### <span id="page-49-2"></span><span id="page-49-1"></span>**7.10.3 Key management for loading entitlements**

In order to secure entitlements that are loaded when carrier media are produced, or afterwards, special keys and identifiers must be generated for the products.

[Figure 7â10](#page-50-1) shows the corresponding use cases. The key management system for applications also has to be available when the entitlement is loaded onto the application.

<span id="page-50-0"></span>![](_page_50_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 7â10 Use case "Key management for products/entitlements"** 

### <span id="page-50-1"></span>**7.10.4 Key management for use with the service provider**

Providers and issuers require a key management system to initialise carrier media, load applications and issue entitlements.

The public transport service provider requires the keys and other information necessary to read and evaluate entitlements.

This information has to be available in the verification system.

To this end, the security manager normally generates specific SAMs (service provider SAMs) for the service provider using the key management system. Service provider SAMs can contain key information from multiple providers of products, applications and carrier media. A selection is put together by the security manager in accordance with the needs of the service provider.

# <span id="page-51-0"></span>**8 Security considerations**

## **8.1 Definitions relating to security and privacy**

Security can be divided into three aspects or categories, all of which this document intends to examine. They are:

- Safety
- Information security
- Privacy

These categories can be subdivided as follows:

1 Safety

Safety is not to be confused with reliability/correctness or quality of service. Reliability means that the system works correctly according to its specifications. Experience shows that every technical system is sometimes subject to failure. Safety is understood as the capacity of a system, when it does fail, not to enter uncontrollable states that would endanger the system itself or its environment (fail-safe). At the same time, the system should also continue to respond as far as possible in compliance with its specification (fault tolerance). Safety, therefore, basically implies protection against unintended incidents.

2 Information security

Unlike safety, information security offers protection against intentional attacks. In the field of information security, security targets can be formulated as belonging to the following categories:

- a Confidentiality: confidentiality means protection against the unauthorised disclosure of information. Confidential data and information may only be accessible to authorised people in an authorised manner. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against access by unauthorised persons.
- b Integrity: integrity means ensuring that data is correct (intact) and that systems function properly. Formulated as a protection target this means: stored information and information that is to be communicated is to be protected against unauthorised modification.
- c Availability: the availability of services, of the functions of an IT system, IT applications and IT networks â and also of information â exists if these things are always available to their users when required. Formulated as a protection target this means: information and operating systems are to be protected against being withheld improperly.
- d Unlinkability: if two communication elements within a system are unlinkable, it means they are not any more or less related to one another than is already known and established. Within the system, no further information about the relationship between these communication elements can be obtained. In practical terms this means that a single user can make use of services and resources more than one time, without third parties being able to see that these access events (in the communication model: messages) are related through the user.
- e Unobservability: an event is unobservable if it cannot be determined whether it has happened or not. Sender-unobservability means it cannot be seen that anything has been sent; recipient-unobservability is the same: it is not possible to ascertain

that something has been received. Relationship-unobservability means that it cannot be seen that anything is sent from the group of possible senders to the group of possible recipients.

- f Anonymity: anonymity is the condition of being unidentifiable within one's anonymity group. Using the term unlinkability, anonymity can be more precisely defined as the unlinkability of the identity of a user and an event initiated by that user. Senderanonymity is therefore unlinkability of sender and message, and recipientanonymity is the unlinkability of message and recipient.
- g Authenticity: the term authenticity designates a situation in which the partner in a communication process is actually the person he claims to be. Authentic information is information that genuinely comes from the stated source. The term is not only used when people's identity is being checked, but also for IT components and applications.
- h Non-repudiation: protection should exist against the possibility of denying that messages have been sent and received by persons whose authenticity has been determined.
- i Accountability: binding validity joins together the IT security targets of authenticity and non-repudiation. When transmitting information this means that the source of the information has proven its identity, and that the receipt of the message cannot be disputed.
- 3 Privacy

The purpose of privacy is to protect against infringements of the personal rights of the individual through the handling of his personal data.

Privacy refers to the protection of personal data against possible misuse by third parties (not to be confused with data security) [EU\_REF].

The following additional terms will also be used throughout:

1 Security targets

Security targets are the security-related and safety-related objectives undertaken when setting up an IT system. This document lays down specific security targets within the areas of use and application scenarios. Infringing upon the security targets causes direct damage to the entity whose security target is violated.

2 Threats

Threats are immediate risks to the security targets of an application.

These may be the result of an active attack on one or more security targets by exploiting the systems weakness, or they may take the form of potential vulnerabilities in the system such as the lack of a fallback solution.

3 Safeguards

Safeguards are actual recommended actions that counter one or more threats. The safeguards described in this document are intended to be applied meaningfully and according to need, which means they are suggested on the basis of economic feasibility and resistance to manipulation: how expensive is a safeguard, and what are the financial damages that it can limit or prevent?

4 Residual risk

Generally speaking it is not possible to counteract every single threat in such a way that a system offers perfect security. The residual risk is thus the risk of potential threat that remains after a series of safeguards have been put in place. The extent of this risk depends on the counter-measures that can be applied, how complex they are, and, above all, what the costs are in relation to the benefits for the entity involved. The entity has to take explicit liability for the residual risk.

# <span id="page-53-1"></span><span id="page-53-0"></span>**8.2 Definition of the security targets**

It would be very unusual indeed for all of the safety aspects relating to safety, information security and privacy within a given application scenario to be of equal importance, or indeed for every single one of them to be relevant at all. The first challenge when designing a secure RFID system is therefore to formulate specific security targets.

Within the areas of use relating to eTicketing, certain superior security targets specific to the application area can be recognised, based on the generic security targets mentioned earlier:

- 1 Protection of electronic entitlements (represents the protection targets integrity and authenticity)
- 2 Safety of the RFID system
- 3 Protection of the customer's privacy (a general requirement representing the protection targets confidentiality, unlinkability, unobservability, anonymity and privacy)

The subsidiary security targets listed in Section [8.2.4](#page-58-1) can be derived from the assessments of the entities' security targets contained in the following sections.

| SSI2                             | Protection of<br>entitlements  | The manipulation of, damage to and in particular the counterfeit<br>ing of entitlements could incur considerable commercial damage<br>to the product provider, product owner and service provider.                                  |
|                                  |                                | Securing entitlements against counterfeiting is an important ob<br>jective for the service provider. Entitlements are also used in the<br>service provider's system infrastructure, and they must be safe<br>guarded there as well. |
| SSI3                             | Protection of<br>usage data    | Usage data is of great value to the service provider. It is used for<br>invoicing and for planning capacities.                                                                                                                      |

### <span id="page-59-1"></span>**8.2.5 Formation of protection demand categories**

Three protection demand categories are formed on the basis of the security targets described in Section [8.2.4](#page-58-1). Category 1 represents the lowest protection demand, category 3 the highest.

The following table lists the criteria for allocating protection requirements to protection demand categories, these criteria being based on the assumption that no protective measures have been put in place.

# <span id="page-66-1"></span>**8.4 Safeguards**

This section describes the safeguards that can be used to counter the threats detailed in Section [8.3.](#page-61-0) These safeguards are defined in such a way that, when built successively upon each other, they afford increasing levels of security â in cases where different levels are possible. Level 1 represents the lowest security category, level 3 the highest.

<span id="page-67-0"></span>Level 3+ is used to denote additional safeguards that increase the security of a system, but whose expense may exceed the value of the extra security gained disproportionately.

The security levels are oriented around the system's protection demand categories. A threat to a security target that has been allocated to protection demand category 3 should be countered by safeguards of security level 3. Generally threats of a specific protection demad category can be countered by safeguards of the same or higher protection demand categories.

The following safeguards are generally not defined as isolated measures, but rather are to be understood as "safeguard packages". As a rule, the security of components and interfaces, and of the system as a whole, can only be increased in a meaningful way if safeguards are employed across the board as packages. Furthermore, alternative possibilities are defined within the security levels; for instance, a secure environment (which generally does not exist) can replace the encrypted storage of data.

The following table shows the scheme of safeguard or measure codes and used abbreviations.

**Table 8â19 Coding scheme of safeguard measures** 

### <span id="page-67-2"></span>**8.4.1 Selection of cryptographic methods and key length**

The following safeguards generally require cryptographic methods that shall follow the rules given in [ALGK\_BSI]. [ALGK\_BSI] defines methods, key length and the useful life of those. [ALGK\_BSI] will be updated made available to the public by BSI on a regular basis.

Existing implementations shall comply to the rules given in [ALGK\_BSI] or [TR\_eCARD]. With the next evolution step existing systems shall be migrated in order to comply to [ALGK\_BSI]. This update has to be carried out in an appropriate period of time. Under this precondition, the utilization of the TDES algorithm is allowed for authentication, encryption and generation of MAC.

### <span id="page-67-1"></span>**8.4.2 Safeguards for the protection of the system as a whole**

The following safeguards relate to the system as a whole, the focus being on the sales, inspection and management systems, including the associated interfaces.

Separate sections will deal with the RF interface; readers installed in terminals, vending machines and so on; carrier media; and the key management system.

| General | The functions of the carrier medium and entitlement can theoretically be emu<br>lated by programmable devices (e.g. PDAs) that use contact-less interfaces.                                                                                                                           |                   |  |

# <span id="page-99-0"></span>**9 Definition of product-specific application scenarios**

We will now examine the processes described in Chapters [6](#page-31-1) and [7](#page-40-1) to provide examples of how particular products can be handled.

We have chosen the kind of product mix that is common among regional transport associations.

The following products will be discussed:

- 1 Local multi-journey entitlement (value of max. â¬20, non-interoperable)
- 2 E-ticket (interoperable and non-interoperable)
- 3 Interoperable fare calculation and multi-application compatibility

This combination covers most possible scenarios.

The selected application scenarios will be discussed for these products in more detail in Chapter [10](#page-105-1) and [11](#page-134-1).

## **9.1 Application scenario: "Local multi-journey entitlement"**

#### Entitlement

Purchasing this product entitles the customer to multiple use for single journeys on local transport. Interoperability is not required in this case. The entitlement is non-personalised.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value is normally less than â¬20. If this value is exceeded, then appropriate solutions should be used for the components.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media are normally employed when using entitlements:

| Carrier medium                   | Usage model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                         |

**Table 9â1 Carrier media used for local multi-journey entitlements** 

The cost of carrier media is of great importance to the product provider. The cost of the carrier must be commensurate with the value of the entitlement. In the case of carriers that can only accommodate one application, their cost must be covered in full.

Loading applications and entitlements onto customer media that already exist eliminates the cost of the medium altogether. However, loading an additional application onto a multiapplication card does require special security precautions and a special infrastructure.

### Relevant processes

The following processes from Chapter [6](#page-31-1) must be taken into account for each carrier medium:

| Carrier medium                   | Process numbers                                           | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Table 9â2 Relevant processes** 

# <span id="page-101-0"></span>**9.2 Application scenario: "Electronic season ticket"**

We will examine this application scenario for an interoperable as well as a non-interoperable, personalised product.

### Entitlement

Purchasing this product entitles the customer, within a defined time period, to make use of transport services within a certain area or on a particular route. The transport is within the zone of a service provider or service providers that are already associated with each other. An example of this is a student's monthly travel card.

### Commercial value

The commercial value of a single entitlement can range from â¬20 and â¬500; depending on the product (see Chapter [2\)](#page-13-1). In the interoperable version, the damages incurred between the different partners of the IFM should be considered when analysing the commercial impact of a successful attack.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media can be employed when using the entitlement:

| Carrier medium                    | Usage model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                   |

## **9.3 Application scenario: "Interoperable unceasing entitlement with automatic fare calculation"**

### Product

Purchasing this personalised product entitles the customer to utilise any transport service in any area and on any route. The entitlement is interoperable, which means it is valid at all times and with every service provider that supports this special application. The customer has to register at the beginning of his journey using his customer medium at a terminal, and de-register, or check out, at the end of the journey. The fare is calculated automatically on the basis of the local fares.

<span id="page-103-0"></span>The VDV Core Application provides an implementation example of how this product is handled. Without having to know the fares or zones, the customer can use the services of any public transport service provider that employs compatible inspection equipment.

#### Commercial value

The commercial value of the entitlement can range from tens of euros to several thousand euros.

#### Carrier media

The following carrier media can be employed when using the entitlement:

# <span id="page-105-1"></span><span id="page-105-0"></span>**10 Suggestions on implementing the system as a whole**

This Chapter describes, as an example, the entire system for the "eTicketing for public transport" application area.

The overall system is made up of the eTicketing infrastructure and the carrier media. The term eTicketing infrastructure refers collectively to all of the system components and associated interfaces installed by the product providers, service providers and system manager.

The solution presented here can cover the aforementioned role descriptions, processes and application scenarios in their maximum complexity. Variations on it are conceivable in the case of specialised implementations in actual use. In particular, simplification of the role model, and reductions in the number of different media, applications, products, and of the public transport entities involved, would also enable simplifications of the system and the processes.

The focus of these considerations and of the suggestions regarding safeguards is on the implementation of the RFID interface and the directly connected components, carrier medium and reader. The safeguards for the carrier media are highly dependent on the application scenario concerned, and are described in Chapter [11](#page-134-1) in their various manifestations. General information about the carrier media can be found in Section [10.2.](#page-129-1)

<span id="page-105-2"></span>![](_page_105_Figure_6.jpeg)

The following diagram shows the system as a whole and its principal components.

# <span id="page-106-0"></span>**10.1 Suggestions on executing the eTicketing infrastructure**

### <span id="page-106-1"></span>**10.1.1 Determining the protection demand for the eTicketing infrastructure**

The following general considerations apply to the eTicketing infrastructure, and these should be included when determining the protection requirements:

- 1 The systems in [Figure 10â1](#page-105-2) should simultaneously support a range of different products and carrier media, as defined in the proposed application scenarios.
- 2 Data relating to particular persons must be managed and processed.
- 3 Usage data will be generated and must be processed.
- 4 Calculation data must be logged and forwarded if "automatic fare calculation" applications and products are to be supported. Interoperability is required.
- 5 The case of interoperability being assured by agreements between the entities can also be examined as an option.

On the basis of the criteria described in Section [8.2.5](#page-59-1), the eTicketing infrastructure can be assigned to the following protection demand categories:

| Security target |                                                              | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                                        |

**Table 10â1 The system's protection requirements** 

### **10.1.2 Interfaces in the system as a whole**

The system shown in [Figure 10â1](#page-105-2) is reliant on interaction between all the system components. In order to facilitate the business processes described in Chapter [6](#page-31-1), the technical interfaces and operative interaction between the components have to be specified.

Furthermore, agreements must be made between the entities to regulate the responsibilities and the operational procedures.

### **10.1.2.1 Threats relevant to the eTicketing infrastructure**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the security targets used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-106-1)

**Table 10â4 Safeguards for the system as a whole** 

### **10.1.2.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### <span id="page-112-0"></span>**10.1.3 Readers**

Readers control the flow of information for reading from and writing to the carrier medium, using a contact-less communication protocol. The reader (PCD as defined by ISO/IEC14443) has the active role (master), while the carrier medium (PICC as defined by ISO/IEC14443) is passive (slave).

Readers are integrated into various system components:

- 1 Sales systems at sales points
- 2 Vending machines
- 3 Service desks
- 4 CICO and activation terminals for checking in and out when using electronic tickets.
- 5 Mobile inspection units

The CICO and activation terminals must have the following features:

- 1 Contact-less read/write unit with interface as defined by ISO/IEC14443A/B Part 1-4.
- 2 Capacity to store all usage data until the next data exchange with the central system.
- 3 Parallel support of multiple carrier media, applications and products (selection using ID).
- 4 Basic cryptographic functions.
- 5 Support for SAMs. Multiple SAM slots should be available (four is currently standard).
- 6 The result of the validation should be displayed visually.
- 7 At turnstiles, the length of time taken to read the media, validate the entitlement and signal authorisation or open the barrier should not exceed 300 ms. The reader, and the other components involved, must be designed to perform accordingly.

**Table 10â7 Safeguards for the reader and its applications** 

### **10.1.3.3 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **10.1.4 Sale, inspection and management systems**

### **10.1.4.1 Sales systems**

Access to the products must be easy and inexpensive for all potential customers, which is why a range of points of sale should be supported. These are described in the following:

### **Sales point**

This could be, for instance, the office of a transport company (e.g. *CA customer contract partner*) or a travel agent.

#### Sales procedure

The customer visits the sales point in person and purchases the product there:

- Identification, if required, is by identity card.
- The booking is done in dialogue with the customer at the sales point.
- Payment is made at the sales point.

If the carrier medium can be produced there and then, or the entitlement can be loaded onto an existing customer medium (see "*Technical equipment*"), then the customer can take the

product away with him straight away. If not, then the product and the carrier medium are sent by post or held at the sales point, ready for subsequent collection.

#### Technical equipment

The sales point has direct access to the ticket sales system. This is a precondition for services such as seat reservation.

In many instances it makes commercial sense to install equipment such as an RFID ticket printer which can initialise and load entitlements onto certain carrier media. Furthermore, a simple contact-less reader at the sales point can provide a cost-effective way of loading entitlements onto an existing customer medium. If such a contact-less reader exists, then in future it could become possible to utilise an electronic proof of identity as a means of securely and automatically transferring personal data into the ticket system (e.g. for setting up a customer account), or for secure identification.

Personal and IT infrastructure at the sales point is not always trustworthy.

#### **Vending and collection machines**

At vending machines, products are sold and issued in a direct interaction between the vending machine and the customer.

Vending machines are installed in customer centres, railway stations, bus and tram stops, and also inside vehicles. They are especially suitable for selling high-demand products which do not require complex procedures to order or produce.

Vending machines that are used in vehicles must be able to work offline. The exchange of data with a sales system is only possible at certain intervals.

#### Selling personalised Products

At present there is no method of identifying a customer for the first time, securely and automatically. This means that registration as defined in Process P1A cannot take place at a vending machine, and customer accounts cannot be set up. This may change in future with the introduction of the electronic identity card (eID).

It is however possible to load new entitlements onto media belonging to known customers who already possess a known personalised customer medium. In this case, identification is done using the existing customer medium itself.

#### Selling anonymous products

In the simplest case, anonymous carrier media and entitlements are sold through vending machines.

The customer purchases or collects the product at a vending machine:

- Booking is done at a vending machine.
- Payment is made directly using methods such as Maestro or credit cards.
- When collecting, the customer identifies himself using his own customer medium, or in future an eID or other electronic means of identification.

The carrier medium for the product purchased is produced by the vending machine. Alternatively, the entitlement can be loaded onto an existing customer medium (see "*Technical equipment*"). The customer can then take the product away.

#### Collecting pre-ordered products

Vending machines can serve as issuing points for products ordered by Internet or telephone.

If the vending machine is used for collecting pre-ordered entitlements, then the customer must always identify himself. If the customer possesses his own customer medium then this can be used for identification and for receiving the entitlement. If not, then other processes must be used for identification (e.g. credit card).

#### Technical equipment

The vending machine requires direct access to the ticket sales system, at least for some of the time. Another condition is that it must incorporate a ticket printer with an in-built reader which can initialise the carrier media issued, and load entitlements onto them.

If the machine is to be able to load entitlements onto existing customer media, then uninterrupted access is required to the ticket sales system and the management system for carrier media and applications. A compatible reader must also be installed in the vending machine.

#### **Internet, call centres, ordering by post**

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order by telephone, Internet or fax from any location:

- The booking, choice of seat etc. can be made in a direct interaction when using the Internet or telephone. Written orders do not allow this.
- Payment is made by Maestro, credit card or direct debit.
- For secure identification, the personal data sent by the customer may have to be checked.

The carrier medium and product are produced centrally and sent by post. Alternatively it can be agreed that the product will be collected somewhere such as an issuing point or vending machine (see Vending and collection machines).

#### Technical equipment

The product provider operates an Internet sales platform or a call centre. The customer does not require any particular technical equipment.

The carrier medium and product can be produced using a mass personaliser in a secure environment.

#### **Internet**

#### Sales procedure

The customer places the order interactively by Internet from any location (e.g. at home).

If the customer has a customer medium which already contains the necessary application, then the required product can be loaded onto it. If a chip card is being used, then a contactless reader is required â such as one that works with a home computer, for example. If an NFC mobile device is to be used as the customer medium, then the product can also be loaded "Over the Air":

- <span id="page-118-0"></span>â¢ Booking, seat reservation and so on can be done in a direct interaction when using the Internet.
- Identification is done using the customer medium and the personal data stored in the application.
- Payment is made using Maestro, credit card or direct debit.

The entitlement is loaded directly into the application on the customer medium.

If the customer does not yet have a customer medium but does have a contact-less reader, then secure identification of the customer will in future be able to take place using a eID, thus enabling the customer medium to be ordered securely and conveniently.

#### Technical equipment

The product provider operates an Internet sales platform, which is connected to the key, carrier and application management systems. The customer requires a customer medium containing the appropriate application, and â if a chip card or eID is being used â a contact-less home reader device.

Provided suitable media, readers and protocols are used, there will be no weak-spots in the process of loading new products onto an existing customer medium, or registering and ordering (see Process P1A.4).

#### **10.1.4.2 Ticket system**

The ticket system supports the primary selling and handling processes:

- 1 Registering and ordering
- 2 Creating the entitlement
- 3 Payment, and checking creditworthiness
- 4 Managing the entitlements sold
- 5 Forwarding the necessary data to the verification system

Customer data and orders are stored in the ticket system. Provided the transport service and product support it, seating can also be allocated using seating plans which are also stored there. The ticket system also incorporates a procedural management system which performs actions such as address comparisons and payment processing including credit checks, and which also initiates the production and dispatch of carrier media and entitlements.

<span id="page-119-0"></span>![](_page_119_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 10â3 An example of a ticket system with possible process flows** 

A ticket system has interfaces to the key management system and the system which administers the carrier media and applications. All of the information required to enter a special event (apart from the information transferred in the key management system) is gathered together by the ticket system and sent to the service provider via a defined interface.

There are other interfaces to the sales points and the places where the carrier media are produced. This also includes sales and distribution, and the management of loading applications and products onto existing media via the Internet.

It can be assumed that a ticket system will be housed in a secure environment. Personaliser SAMs must be connected to it in order to be able to produce entitlements and load them onto carrier media.

From the point of view of the service provider, more than one ticket system can be used.

### **10.1.4.3 Central verification system**

The verification system helps the service provider to check the customers' journey entitlements, and to gather and pass on information relevant to invoicing. This requires the following functions:

1 Support of Process P3 for checking in, checking out and if necessary activation.

- <span id="page-120-0"></span>2 Support for the particular carrier media, applications and products.
	- a Implementation of the technical procedures required to support the carrier media, applications and products.
	- b Implementation and management of SAMs.
- 3 Control of terminals (CICO terminals, access barriers, mobile conductor's terminals, etc).
- 4 Receiving, distributing and utilising the information provided by the ticket systems.
- 5 Receiving, distributing and utilising the keys and identifiers provided by the system manager and registrar.
- 6 Reporting invoicing-related data and usage history to the ticket systems.

The terminals in public transport systems are not usually connected permanently to a data network. This applies especially to terminals in vehicles. That means all of the information required for entry, evaluation and activation of entitlements, and where applicable fare calculation, has to be stored locally in the terminals.

#### **10.1.4.4 Terminals**

The job of a terminal is to read, evaluate and if necessary activate the entitlement when the customer checks in or out. A contact-less reader is integrated into the terminal.

In normal operation, stationary terminals connect daily for at least a certain amount of time to the central verification system via a data network (LAN or WLAN) or by exchanging memory media. Information required to evaluate the entitlements is updated in this way. CICO data is also sent by that means from the terminal to the central system. In the case of mobile devices and devices in vehicles, longer intervals may lapse between connections, and data may be exchanged using physical data carriers.

Since the terminals are connected only temporarily to the backend system, all of the functions required to communicate with the carrier medium and application must be supported locally in the terminal. This can mean considerable expense when introducing new technologies. It is therefore sensible, when defining applications, to base communication protocols, cryptographic methods etc. on open, standardised processes and to rely on flexible, hardware-independent methods of implementation.

As well as the application-specific functions, all of the information specific to particular events that is required to evaluate the entitlement must be stored locally in the terminal (service provider ID, blacklists, carrier medium ID, application ID, product IP, various levels of keys, and so on). It must also be possible to store the access history temporarily in the terminal.

The security-related safeguards for the reader incorporated into the terminal are detailed in Section [10.1.3.2](#page-114-1).

We can differentiate between permanently installed and mobile devices.

1 Permanently installed devices

Some CICO terminals are installed permanently on platforms or at tram or bus stops. These devices are usually connected to the central verification system via a LAN.

Some European cities utilise permanent turnstiles to regulate access to the platform. These turnstiles have terminals with readers integrated into them, and are connected to the central verification system via a LAN. Once the entitlement has been evaluated successfully, access is granted by unlocking the turnstile and allowing it to rotate. The turnstiles are situated at the entrances to the platform.

- 2 Mobile devices
	- a Mobile terminals

<span id="page-121-0"></span>Some CICO terminals are installed in vehicles. These devices can only exchange data with the central verification system temporarily. They are equipped with service provider SAMs.

b Monitoring units

There are also portable inspection units used by conductors and similar personnel to inspect tickets and also for sales purposes. These must also be fully operational when offline. They are fitted with personaliser SAMs and service provider SAMs.

#### **10.1.4.5 Service desks**

In real-life operation, a certain amount of defective customer media, incorrect operations, attacks on security and fraud attempts is inevitable. The service desk is the point of contact if problems occur when checking in.

Valid entitlements do not expire when the inspection equipment or customer medium fails, or if the customer does something incorrect. At the service desk, which is run by the service provider or product provider, the customer can receive a replacement entitlement or a refund.

For this to happen it must be possible to perform Process P4, "Blocking entitlements and carrier media", and to issue a replacement medium, quickly and efficiently.

The following tasks are undertaken at the service desk:

- 1 Check the function of the carrier medium and the status of the entitlement.
- If a fault occurs, then:

2 Check whether the medium is genuine and/or check the identity of the customer. If positive, then:

- 3 Block the medium and entitlement presented.
- 4 Issue a replacement medium with a new entitlement.
- 5 Update the information in the ticket system and the carrier and application management systems.
- 6 Transfer the information from the ticket system to the verification system.

Emergency scenarios for a verification system that uses access barriers malfunctions are based on the personnel who keep order, and the service desk. Both are therefore of key importance to system security. If an attacker succeeds in causing a malfunction which overburdens the personnel and the service desk, it is equivalent to a successful DoS attack on the entire verification system.

#### **10.1.4.6 Management system for carrier media and applications**

For the processes of loading applications and entitlements, and for the processes in which the customer medium is used for identification and for utilising transport services, it is important to know the status of the carrier medium and the applications on it.

For this reason, the life-cycle of any carrier medium used in the system must be documented reliably. To this end a database is used which is connected via interfaces to the ticket system and the key management system. It contains information such as the following for every carrier medium:

- ID of carrier medium
- Type, version
- Provider of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- <span id="page-122-0"></span>â¢ Issuer of carrier medium (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blocked)
- Stored applications (see below)
- etc.

Similarly, the life-cycle of the applications stored on the carrier medium must also be documented. Several different applications can be stored.

- ID of application
- Type, version
- Application provider (ID via registrar)
- Application issuer (ID via registrar)
- Customer
- Status (e.g. new/active/blocked/delete)
- Stored entitlements including ID of product provider
- Active entitlements / deletable entitlements

#### **10.1.4.7 Threats relevant to sale, inspection and management systems**

The following threats relevant to the interfaces of the system as a whole can be deduced from the assumptions used to determine the protection demand in Section [10.1.1.](#page-106-1)

**Table 10â9 Safeguards for sale, inspection and management systems** 

### **10.1.4.9 Residual risks**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **10.1.5 Key management**

The job of the key management system is to provide keys used by multiple entities for all of the carrier media, applications and products in the system, and to do so securely and reliably. Key management is the responsibility of the security manager. A number of use cases are described in Section [7.3](#page-41-2). [GSHB] can be used as a general guideline for implementation. <span id="page-126-0"></span>Keys are generated individually for each purpose. As far as possible, a distinct key is allocated to each form of interaction (e.g. loading applications, writing entitlements, reading entitlements, writing usage data). The precise characteristics have to be ascertained for each application scenario as part of the creation of a specific security concept that harmonises with the role model.

The keys are generated in a secure environment and stored in a secure database. The various forms of SAM are also produced in this secure environment. The documentation of the life-cycle of the SAMs that are produced and issued is another of the key management system's tasks.

The SAMs and keys are generated by the security manager or his agents as and when users need them. The following types of SAM are basically supported:

| Initialiser SAMs      | Initialiser SAMs are required to initialise carrier media and load<br>applications.                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personaliser SAMs     | Personaliser SAMs are required to load entitlements in the ap<br>propriate applications.                                                                            |
| Service provider SAMs | Service provider SAMs are required by the service provider to<br>read and activate entitlements, and in some cases to send the<br>usage data to the carrier medium. |

Where required there may also be special SAMs that help transmit the product ID of the suppliers of carrier media, applications and entitlements securely onto the carrier medium.

Key information is normally loaded onto a SAM when the user requires it. The aim of an initialiser is, for example, to enable all of the carrier media that occur in its area to be initialised with the necessary applications without changing the SAM.

This kind of user-specific SAM must be configured under an agreement between the user of the SAM and the system manager.

The SAM should support the secure loading of new keys via a network. Ideally, updating can be done by the security manager directly.

#### **10.1.5.1 Key management for public transport service providers / SAMs for service providers**

Specific key information is required to evaluate entitlements. The reliability and security of the key management system involved in this is of critical importance to the overall concept. If the keys held by the service provider do not correspond with those in the carrier media and entitlements used for entry, then the evaluation of entitlements will not work. If keys are lost or made public, then the entire security concept will be discredited.

In this proposal, special SAMs are issued to the service provider as the operator of the verification system. These service provider SAMs contain the key information relevant to the services offered, and must be integrated into the terminals.

When service provider SAMs are used key management is restricted to the handing-over, handling and management of the SAMs. Since the keys are protected against unauthorized reading when using SAMs, the risk â and therefore the extent of the protection required â is limited. The use of standardised SAMs also reduces the expense of adapting to new applications.

The initialisation of carrier media is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.2](#page-40-2), [7.3](#page-41-2) and [7.10.2.](#page-48-2) There are different ways of facilitating this:

- 1 Initialisation by a special service provider. This is used particularly in cases where large numbers of chip cards are issued.
- 2 Initialisation controlled from the ticket system, in vending machines or ticket printers.
- 3 Applications are loaded onto existing customer media under the management of the ticket system.

<span id="page-132-0"></span>The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the initialisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are often used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the initialisation system.

### **10.2.2 Personalising carrier media and applications**

Loading entitlements is by Process P2 and the use cases described in Sections [7.4](#page-42-2) and [7.10.3.](#page-49-2) There are different ways of facilitating this:

- 1 The entitlement is loaded by a special service provider during the initialisation process. This is used particularly in cases where large numbers of chip cards are issued.
- 2 Entitlement loading in vending machines or ticket printers, controlled from the ticket system.
- 3 Entitlements are loaded onto existing applications and customer media under the management of the ticket system.

The actual procedures and processes have to be implemented in the personalisation systems in accordance with the specifications of the carrier medium and the applications. Initialiser SAMs are used for key management, and these have to be integrated into the personalisation system.

### **10.2.3 Determining the protection demand for the carrier media**

The choice of protection demand category is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-134-1)

### **10.2.4 Threats to the carrier medium**

The following table lists the threats to the carrier medium. The allocation of protection categories is highly dependent on the product being supported, and therefore on the application scenario concerned, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11](#page-134-1).

**Table 10â14 Threats relevant to the carrier medium** 

### **10.2.5 Definition of specific safeguards**

The allocation of safeguards is dependent on the application scenario, so it will be dealt with in Chapter [11.](#page-134-1)

# <span id="page-134-1"></span><span id="page-134-0"></span>**11 Suggestions on executing the product-specific application scenarios**

# **11.1 The "Local multi-journey entitlement" application scenario**

### **11.1.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "Local multi-journey entitlement" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 Low commercial value (< â¬20)
- 2 No personal data
- 3 No usage data
- 4 No calculation data
- 5 These entitlements are used more than once, and the medium is carried around between uses.
- 6 They may be combined with other application scenarios and products. The product can be combined with higher-value products in the same application area. When determining the protection demand it must be borne in mind that this scenario may endanger other products with a higher value.

For reasons of minimization, it is usually only the Smart Ticket which can be produced specially for this product and issued with an entitlement. In the case of all other carrier media, only the loading of the application and entitlement onto an existing customer medium is advisable, for reasons of cost. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-59-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

#### **Table 11â3 Use cases relevant to the "Local multi-journey entitlement" application scenario**

The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases.

### **11.1.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements of product type "Local multi-journey entitlement" are issued on carrier media of type "Smart Ticket". The carrier medium is initialised with an application which can contain one or more entitlements. The chip's security mechanisms are limited to the blocking of certain memory sectors and possibly simple access protection (see Section [10.2](#page-129-1)).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is done together with the personalisation of the entitlement in a mass personaliser, at the sales point or in a vending machine.

When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the blocked-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

In the system as a whole, the "Local multi-journey entitlement" product is used together with higher-value products such as "automatic fare calculation". It must be ensured that attacks on these higher-value products are not made possible by means of attacks on the "Local multi-journey entitlement" product. This possibility can be discounted if the cost of cloning, counterfeiting or emulating a usable entitlement is greater than the purchase price. This

means there is a need to protect against counterfeiting, cloning and emulating, especially with the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium.

In this application scenario, customer media are allowed that potentially may enable entitlements to be emulated (NFC mobile device). This means there is a need to protect against emulation of the "Smart Ticket".

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â2.](#page-137-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-66-1)

#### **Table 11â4 Safeguards when utilising Smart Tickets**

### **11.1.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "Smart Ticket" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.1.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "multi-application card" carrier medium type is basically impossible to depict with this entitlement for reasons of cost. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Local multi-journey entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "multi-application card", which are already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the appropriate application will also have to be loaded later onto the card.

When using an existing "multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the blocked-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

### **11.1.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.1.3.5 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium type is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Local multi-journey entitlement" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "NFC mobile device", which are already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC mobile device.

When an existing "NFC mobile device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

When using the entitlement, the customer must validate it before or straight after entering the vehicle. In systems with barriers, activation is upon entry. You also leave the blocked-off area using the carrier medium and the entitlement.

#### **Table 11â6 Safeguards when utilising NFC mobile device**

### **11.1.3.6 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **11.2 Electronic season ticket**

### **11.2.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "electronic season ticket" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 High commercial value (â¬20 < electronic season ticket < â¬500). Extreme case: German Railway railcard (> â¬3000)
- 2 Personal data
- 3 No usage data
- 4 No calculation data
- 5 These tickets are used constantly, and the medium is carried around between uses as well.
- 6 They may be combined with other application scenarios and products. The product can be combined with higher-value products in the same application area. When determining the protection demand it must be borne in mind that this scenario may endanger other products with a higher value.

The "electronic season ticket" product is normally issued on a "secure chip card" or "multiapplication card" carrier medium, or loaded onto existing "multi-application card" or "NFC mobile device" carrier media. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

If interoperability has to be assured technically between the service providers and product providers, then the product is normally issued on the "multi-application card" carrier medium. If not, then the "secure chip card" is the carrier medium most often used in practice.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-59-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

| Security target |                                                                          | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |

#### **Table 11â9 Use cases relevant to the "electronic season ticket" application scenario**

The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases.

### **11.2.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "secure chip card" carrier medium**

#### Conditions particular to this case

Entitlements of product type "electronic season ticket" are issued on carrier media of type "secure chip card" or "multi-application card". The carrier medium is initialised with an application which can contain one or more entitlements. The chip's security mechanisms normally include authentication, access protection and secure transmission (see Section [10.2](#page-129-1)).

The initialisation of the carrier medium is done together with the personalisation of the entitlement in a mass personaliser, at the sales point or in a vending machine.

Furthermore, in this application scenario it is assumed that entitlements of product type "electronic season ticket" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "secure chip card", which are already in the customers' possession. The application needed for this must already be on the card. It is not necessary to load new applications in the field.

The entitlement is loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

Checking in and out is necessary only if interoperability is required when using the entitlement, so as to facilitate invoicing between the service providers.

In systems with barriers, access to and from the blocked-off area is by means of the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â8.](#page-148-1) These safeguards are intended to compensate for those threats. The safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-66-1)

**Table 11â10 Safeguards for the "electronic season ticket" entitlement on a "secure chip card"** 

### **11.2.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "secure chip card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.2.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

Conditions particular to this case

If interoperability has to be assured technically, then the "electronic season ticket" entitlement is normally issued on a "multi-application card" carrier medium.

Furthermore, in this application scenario it is assumed that entitlements of product type "electronic season ticket" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "multiapplication card", which are already in the customers' possession. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the appropriate application will also have to be loaded later onto the card.

When using an existing "multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

Checking in and out is necessary only if interoperability is required when using the entitlement, so as to facilitate invoicing between the service providers.

In systems with barriers, access to and from the blocked-off area is by means of the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â8.](#page-148-1) These safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-66-1)

#### **Table 11â11 Safeguards for the "electronic season ticket" entitlement on a "multiapplication card"**

### **11.2.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.2.3.5 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

### Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium type together with an entitlement is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "electronic season ticket" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "NFC mobile device", which are already in the possession of customers. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC mobile device.

When an existing "NFC mobile device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

In systems with barriers, access to and from the blocked-off area is by means of the carrier medium and entitlement.

Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â8.](#page-148-1) These safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-66-1)

#### **Table 11â12 Safeguards for the "electronic season ticket" entitlement on an "NFC mobile device"**

### **11.2.3.6 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

## **11.3 The "Interoperable entitlement with automatic fare calculation" application scenario**

### **11.3.1 Determining the protection demand category**

The following conditions apply to the "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" application scenario and must be taken into consideration when determining the protection demand:

- 1 High commercial value (â¬10 to more than â¬1000)
- 2 Personal data
- 3 Interoperability between the entities must be assured technically:
	- a Sales data
	- b Usage data
	- c Calculation data
- 4 These tickets are used constantly, and the medium is probably carried around all the time between uses as well.
- 5 They may be combined with other application scenarios and products. The product can be combined with lower-value products in the same application area. When determining the protection demand it must be borne in mind that this scenario may be endangered by other product implementations.

<span id="page-158-0"></span>The "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" product is issued on a "multi-application card" carrier medium, or loaded onto existing "multi-application card" or "NFC mobile device" carrier media. Only these cases will be examined in further detail in the following.

On the basis of the criteria discussed in Section [8.2.5](#page-59-1), the application scenario can be allocated to the following protection demand categories:

| Security target |                                                                          | Protection<br>demand<br>category | Criteria for allocating to protection demand category                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |

**Table 11â15 Use cases relevant to the "Interoperable entitlement withcalculation AFC" application scenario** 

<span id="page-162-0"></span>The following sub-sections will define safeguards for each carrier medium, on the basis of the threats described and the relevant use cases.

### **11.3.3.1 Safeguards when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

### Conditions particular to this case

The "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" product is normally issued on a "multi-application card" carrier medium.

Furthermore, in this application scenario it is assumed that entitlements of product type "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "multi-application card", which are already in the customers' possession. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the appropriate application will also have to be loaded later onto the card.

When using an existing "multi-application card", it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the card. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on at the sales point, a vending machine or via the Internet, provided a suitable reader is available.

When using this entitlement, checking in and checking out are necessary so as to facilitate invoicing between the service providers.

In systems with barriers, access to and from the blocked-off area is by means of the carrier medium and entitlement.

### Definition of safeguards

In the following table, safeguards are assigned to the threats in [Table 11â14.](#page-161-1) These safeguards are described in Section [8.4.](#page-66-1)

**Table 11â16 Safeguards for a "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" on a "multiapplication card"** 

### **11.3.3.2 Residual risks when utilising the "multi-application card" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

### **11.3.3.3 Safeguards when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

Conditions particular to this case

The issuing of the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium type together with an entitlement is impossible to depict for reasons of cost and for operative reasons. In this application scenario we have therefore assumed that entitlements of product type "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" will be loaded at a later stage onto carrier media of type "NFC mobile device", which are already in the possession of the customer. This means that â assuming it is not yet there â the relevant application will also have to be loaded into the secure memory of the NFC mobile device.

When an existing "NFC mobile device" is being used, it must always be assumed that other applications and entitlements may already exist on the carrier medium. These other applications and entitlements may originate from different entities who have not necessarily agreed on common rules of usage and behaviour.

The entitlement and, where relevant, the application are loaded on over-the-air, at a sales point or at a vending machine.

In systems with barriers, access to and from the blocked-off area is by means of the carrier medium and entitlement.

#### Definition of safeguards

#### **Table 11â17 Safeguards for a "Interoperable entitlement with AFC" on an "NFC mobile device"**

### **11.3.3.4 Residual risks when utilising the "NFC mobile device" carrier medium**

For technical and commercial reasons, it is not always possible to eliminate threats completely using safeguards. In such cases a certain risk remains.

The residual risk should be determined and documented as part of the planning of the actual implementation.

# <span id="page-168-0"></span>**12 Reference system "VDV Kernapplikation"**

The specification of the system solution VDV Kernapplikation was finalized in 2004. First implementations have been introduced in operations with several service providers in 2005. These systems support the application scenarios "electronic season ticket" and "Interoperable entitlement with AFC". Therefore the statements from chapter [8.4.1](#page-67-2) concerning existing installations apply for VDV Kernapplikation.

The existing implementations of VDV Kernapplikation deviate in some details from the examples given in chapter [10](#page-105-1) and chapter [11:](#page-134-1)

- 1 VDV KA doesn't employ specific safeguards against eavesdropping when transmitting entitlements over the contact-less interface as requested in MS2. KA allows a strict separation of entitlements and data related to a person. Personal data won't be transmitted together with an entitlement. In VDV KA the security target "Protection of the electronic entitlement" is reached even if the entitlement should be openly available. The following safeguards have been put in place to ensure this:
	- a Every entitlement is protected against manipulation by a MAC-mechanism.
	- b Loading, changing or deleting of an entitlement always requires a successful authentication between a valid carrier medium and the reader.
	- c The usage of an entitlement at the station or in the vehicle also requires a successful authentication between the carrier medium and the reader.

These measures do not only prevent manipulation but also emulation and copying of an entitlement onto another carrier media.

- 2 Asymmetric authentication between terminal and carrier media according to RSA uses keys of 1024 bits. The root key has a length of min. 1984 bits; the Sub-CA-Keys are using 1536 bits.
- 3 Symmetric authentication uses the TDES algorithm with keys of 112 bits.
- 4 MAC-protection is using a Retail-MAC based on TDES with keys of 112 bits.

A formal, detailed evaluation of VDV KA was not performed so far. From the current perspective the deviations are regarded as not critical. However, it is requested to introduce compliance to [ALGK\_BSI] with the next step of the system evolution.
