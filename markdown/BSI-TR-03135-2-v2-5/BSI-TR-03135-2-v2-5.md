## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**2. Introduction**

This profiling document is part of Technical Guideline TR-03135 Machine Authentication MRTDs for Pu blic Sector Applications. The Technical Guideline TR-03135 specifies and describes necessary requirements for machine assisted document checks on [Machine Readable Travel Documents \(MRTDs\) in Public Sector Ap](#page-17-1) plications.

The technical description of the checks referenced in this document are specified in Part 1 of TR-03135, see [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2).

### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**2.1. Terminology**

Keywords used within in this document are to be interpreted as described in [\[RFC2119\].](#page-18-3)

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**2.2. Technical terms**

For clarity and better reading, terms are abbreviated. The [glossary](#page-17-0) contains the list of the used abbreviations.

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**3. Operational Scenarios**

This profiling refers to operational [Electronic Machine Readable Travel Document \(eMRTD\) inspection sce](#page-17-2) narios in German Public Sector Applications. In this respect the operational application scenarios are defined in the following chapters.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>**3.1. Stationary application scenarios**

Stationary systems are systems which are permanently installed at border crossings, at police stations or at other localities with raised focus concerning security issues (e. a. government buildings, ministries, embassies or official meeting locations) as well as temporary systems in accordingly prepared sites (e.g. for major events such as sports or music events).

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span>**3.2. Self Service application scenarios**

Self Service systems are systems with which automated or semi-automated document and identity checks are performed (e. g. so-called eGates/[Automated Border Control \(ABC\)](#page-17-3) systems, automated border control systems/gates).

#### <span id="page-5-3"></span>**3.3. Partially mobile application scenarios**

Partially mobile application scenarios usually take place at checkpoints, in patrol cars or vessels, but also in rail, air and shipping traffic environments. This includes, for example portable PC stations, which are the size of a notebook, or a tablet PC. These systems are often equipped with a swipe or full-page reader in order to be able to read the [Machine Readable Zone \(MRZ\)](#page-17-4)[/Card Access Number \(CAN\),](#page-17-5) but also with a [radio-frequency](#page-17-6) [identification \(RFID\)](#page-17-6)-chip reading module.

#### <span id="page-5-4"></span>**3.4. Fully mobile application scenarios**

Fully mobile application scenarios will usually be performed in rail, air and shipping traffic as well as during general patrol duty. The systems are carried by the officer. The devices have the similar size and design as smartphones or tablet PCs.

#### <span id="page-5-5"></span>**3.5. Kiosk application scenarios**

Kiosk application scenarios usually take place at border crossing points (air- or sea-ports). These systems are unengaged and unmanaged pillar styled units that can be operated by the traveller. A traveller can pre-register and pre-process before crossing the border. These systems are equipped with a full-page document reader in order to be able fully read the [MRTD.](#page-17-1) This also includes reading the [RFID](#page-17-6) chip of an [eMRTD](#page-17-2). In addition, such a kiosk system can capture live images of the traveler and fingerprints. An interactive electronic registration prompt guides the traveler through the process.

#### <span id="page-5-6"></span>**3.6. Asylum registration application scenarios**

Asylum registration application scenarios take place when a human seeking asylum is registered.

### <span id="page-6-4"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>**4. Requirements from TR-03135-1**

This chapter details the requirements from [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2) which are relevant for these application profiles.

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>**4.1. Requirements on the document checking system**

The generic requirements of a document checking system SHALL fit the requirements regarding chapter 4 and 5 in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2).

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>**4.2. Requirements on document checks**

#### **4.2.1. General requirements for all scenarios**

If a specific check is implemented it SHALL be performed regarding

- **•** optical checks as specified in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2), chapter 5.5
- **•** electronic checks as specified in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2), chapter 5.6
- **•** combined checks as specified in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\],](#page-18-2) chapter 5.7
- **•** handling of defects as specified in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\],](#page-18-2) chapter 5.8
- **•** digital seal checks as specified in [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2), chapter 5.9

The implementation SHALL support the following SSV check groups if applicable

- **•** GRP\_UV\_DULLNESS: Required to facilitate UV dullness check results and groups all checks that belong to this group.
- **•** GRP\_SSV\_CHECK: Required to facilitate typical pattern checks into one group.
- **•** GRP\_EVAL\_CHECK: Evaluatory check group, required to perform checks that are performed and logged, but do not incorporate into a final check result.

The false negative rate per country SHOULD not exceed 2% for correctly placed, captured and identified do cuments.

#### **4.2.2. Overview of the requirements for the application scenarios**

An overview of the requirements for the different application scenarios is given in [Table 4.1](#page-6-3)

#### **4.2.7. Requirements for Kiosk application scenarios**

Such systems are unengaged and unmanaged kiosk styled units that can be operated by the traveller. The advantage is, that the traveller can pre-register and pre-process before crossing the border. Such systems are often equipped with a full-page reader in order to fully read the [MRTD,](#page-17-1) but this scenario also includes reading the [RFID chip, if present. In addition, a kiosk system SHOULD also capture and process the live face op](#page-17-6) tionally the fingerprint images of the traveller.

The requirements for Kiosk application scenarios are given in [Table 4.18](#page-12-0) (Optical checks), [Table 4.19](#page-12-1) (Elec tronic Checks), [Table 4.20](#page-12-2) (Combined Checks) and [Table 4.21](#page-13-0) (Digital Seal Checks).

**Table 4.21** Requirements for Kiosk application scenarios - Digital Seal Checks

#### **4.2.8. Requirements for asylum registration application scenarios**

A document inspection system needs a recent Master list to perform electronic checks on electronic MRTDs and recent Signer Lists to perform checks on digital seals (see [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2) section 5.6.1).

There are two use cases for retrieving a new list of the type Master List or Signer List.

**•** Automatic Retrieval and Deployment (see [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2) section 5.6.1.1 for the RECOMMENDED imple mentation)

If the list can be automatically retrieved and deployed by the document inspection system, it MUST retrieve and deploy the most recent list at least once every three workdays. It is recommended to check for updates daily and to deploy them immediately.

**•** Manual Retrieval and/or Deployment

If the list has to be retrieved and/or deployed manually, the administrator of the document inspection system MUST retrieve and deploy the most recent list at least once every four calendar weeks.

In this scenario the schema element //dc:UsedLists MUST be present and populated in every generated log. The hash algorithm SHA256 MUST be used to calculate the hash of the list signer certificate.

Checking requirements for asylum registration application scenarios are given in [Table 4.22](#page-13-1) (Optical checks), [Table 4.23](#page-13-2) (Electronic Checks), [Table 4.24](#page-14-1) (Combined Checks) and [Table 4.25](#page-14-2) (Digital Seal Checks).

#### <span id="page-14-0"></span>**4.3. Requirements on operational monitoring**

The document check system SHALL implement the logging schema according to [\[BSI TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2), chapter 6.

This document defines the following levels of logging configurations:

- 1. Basic logging profile
- 2. Standard logging profile
- 3. Standard logging profile with optical evaluation extensions
- 4. Standard logging profile with electronic evaluation extensions
- 5. Full logging profile

The set of extended data nodes is defined for the corresponding checks in [Table 4.26](#page-14-3).

<span id="page-14-3"></span>

| Type of failed check | Extended data nodes (XPath expression) |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Optical Check        | //dco:BasicCheckResult/dco:ScannedArea |
|                      | //dco:ScannedImages                    |
|                      | //dc:DocumentDetails                   |
| Electronic Check     | /dce:ChipFiles                         |
|                      | //dce:Trace                            |
| Combined Check       | //dcc:Mismatch/*                       |
| Digital Seal Check   | //dcs:Data/dcs:Content                 |
| Biometric Check      | //dc:Image                             |

**Table 4.26** Set of extended data nodes for different check types

The document check system SHALL implement all defined logging configurations. Setting the actual logging configuration SHALL be configurable by the application.

#### **4.3.1. Basic logging profile**

Basic logging SHALL contain all non-person related data from a check, including all check results. All data items from the [Extensible Markup Language \(XML\)](#page-17-10) schema SHALL be filled, with the exception of the set of extended data nodes.

#### **4.3.2. Standard logging profile**

Standard logging SHALL contain all available information from Basic profile and provide ad ditional information on the specific **failed** and **undetermined** check(s).

For electronic check errors, the optical document data SHALL be included to allow for cross-comparison of optical and electronic document data.

Depending on the type of error, the relevant sets of extended data nodes detailing the error SHALL be present in the log. Note that extended data nodes are not present if corresponding check was aborted. If inte grity check of a data group failed, then the extended data nodes of the optical check SHALL also be included.

#### **4.3.3. Standard logging profile with optical evaluation extensions**

Standard logging with optical evaluation extensions SHALL contain all information from Standard logging and SHALL contain all extended data nodes for the optical check regardless of the optical check result.

#### **4.3.4. Standard logging profile with electronic evaluation extensions**

Standard logging with electronic evaluation extensions SHALL contain all information from Standard logging and SHALL contain all extended data nodes for the electronic check regardless of the electronic check result.

#### **4.3.5. Standard logging profile with digital seal evaluation extensions**

Standard logging with digital seal evaluation extensions SHALL contain all information from Standard logging and SHALL contain all extended data nodes for the digital seal check regardless of the digital seal check result.

#### **4.3.6. Full logging profile**

Full logging SHALL contain all available information including all extended nodes, regardless of the check results.

#### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**4.4. Requirements on data transmission**

The document check system SHALL implement the transmission and log specification according to [\[BSI](#page-18-2) [TR-03135-1\]](#page-18-2), chapter 6. This requirement is REQUIRED for Stationary, Self Service, and Kiosk application scenarios and RECOMMENDED for Partially Mobile and Fully Mobile application scenarios. Logging data SHOULD be temporarily kept local, if transmission fails and retransmitted the connection is available, pos sibility to manually transfer logs is RECOMMENDED.

### <span id="page-16-0"></span>**5. Conformity**

In order to conform to this Technical Guideline, an Inspection System and Inspection Application SHALL completely implement and meet all requirements from [Chapter 4](#page-6-4) for the used scenario.
