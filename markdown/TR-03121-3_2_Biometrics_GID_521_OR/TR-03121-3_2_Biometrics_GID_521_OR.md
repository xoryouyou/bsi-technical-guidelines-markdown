# <span id="page-8-0"></span>1 Volume Enrolment Scenarios of Identity Documents

This document defines Application Profiles for the enrolment of biometric data specific Identity Docu ments, namely the electronic Passport, German Identity Card and Electronic Residence Per mit.

Note, that with this version only certifications valid until April 30, 2025 will be issued.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>2 Application Profiles

# <span id="page-9-1"></span>2.1 Application Profile German Electronic Passport

The following Application Profile describes the biometric application process for a German [Electronic](#page-150-1) [Passport \(ePass\).](#page-150-1)

The requirements for the application of a German [ePass](#page-150-1) are determined by the [\[BIB\\_PassG\],](#page-151-1) which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of the German Electronic Passport. These requirements are based on the EU regulation 2252/2004, refer to [\[BIB\\_EC\\_2252/2004\].](#page-151-2)

By legal requirements, the inclusion of a facial image is mandatory, the inclusion of fingerprints for persons up to the age of six is not allowed but is mandatory for applicants older than six.

# 2.1.1 Mandatory Process

For the application of a German electronic passport a facial image as well as two fingerprints of the applicant have to be captured electronically[1](#page-9-3) . This is done in accordance with [FM Category Acquisition Hardware](#page-38-2), [FM Category Acquisition Software](#page-42-0) and [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-43-1).

The resulting biometric data of the facial image and fingerprints can be reduced in size by lossy compression. However, multiple lossy compressions SHALL NOT be allowed. For facial images software-based quality as surance SHALL be conducted on the processed and compressed image data. For fingerprints, the compression SHALL be performed after the quality assurance process. The facial image and the fingerprint images as well as additional quality information, which is connected to the biometric data, SHALL be coded and then passed to the calling application.

Hereby, the facial image SHALL be passed to the calling application in two different encoding formats: The applying formats that SHALL be used for storing the facial image in passport and a local re ference storage ("Passregister", [\[BIB\\_PassG\]](#page-151-1), Â§21), are stated within [FM REF-FI-GID,](#page-59-2) [FM REF-FI-CHIP.](#page-59-3) [FM](#page-70-0) [COD-FI-GID](#page-70-0) contains general details on the XML encodings. The software-based quality assurance SHALL be conducted on basis of the processed and compressed images for storage in the chip of the passport.

# 2.1.1.1 Overview Process

<span id="page-9-2"></span>[Figure 2.1](#page-9-2) depicts the biometric overview process of an application for a German [ePass](#page-150-1). The process depicted is for illustration purpose only. Note, that the following sections will detail this process for fingerprint and facial image acquisition.

**Figure 2.1.** Overview Process Biometric Application German [ePass](#page-150-1)

<span id="page-9-3"></span><sup>1</sup> Furthermore a signature is captured, but this is not part of the description within TR Biometrics.

# 2.1.1.2 Facial Image Acquisition Process

The facial image acquisition application system SHALL implement one ore more of the processes defined by the following subsections:

- 1. scan-of-photograph process
- 2. live-enrolment process
- 3. BSI [\[BIB\\_TR-03146\]](#page-151-3) digital-transmission process

In any case, a quality assurance module (software) SHALL be used in the facial image acquisition process. In case a facial image is deemed non-compliant by the quality assurance module, the official SHALL make a final decision regarding exceptions (based on legal rules) for further processing.

The final facial image SHALL be transferred to the calling application twice in different formats, refer to [FM](#page-43-1) [Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-43-1), one image to be stored within the passport chip, and the other facial image to be stored within the local reference storage ("Passregister", refer to [\[BIB\\_PassG\] Â§21\). The software-ba](#page-151-1) sed quality assurance SHALL be conducted on basis of the processed and compressed images for storage in the chip of the passport.

### 2.1.1.2.1 Scan-of-Photograph Process

The facial image MAY be acquired by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official.

The photograph SHALL be compliant with the requirements for biometric images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-151-4). The offi cial manually verifies whether the photograph depicts the applicant. After the official visually inspected the facial image with the help of a photo guideline and, if needed, with the help of a photo template the facial image SHALL be scanned, refer to [FM QA-FI-PT](#page-45-0) and [FM QA-FI-PG.](#page-44-1) Afterwards, the facial image SHALL be processed by the quality assurance module (software).

<span id="page-10-0"></span>[Figure 2.2](#page-10-0) depicts the facial image acquisition process by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official. The process is defined in detail by [PAP ACQ-FI-SV-1: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition](#page-28-4) [by Scanned Image.](#page-28-4)

**Table 2.2** Required Partial Application Processes Application Profile German Electronic Passport

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>2.2 Application Profile German Identity Card

The following Application Profile describes the biometric application process for a German Identity Card.

The requirements for the application of an electronic German Identity Card are determined by the [\[BIB\\_PAuswG\]](#page-151-7), which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of the German Identity Card. By legal requirements, the inclusion of a facial image is mandatory, the inclusion of fingerprints for persons up to the age of six is not allowed. The inclusion of fingerprints for applicants older than six years is mandatory since 02.08.2021.

# 2.2.1 Mandatory Process

For the application of a German Identity Card facial image as well two fingerprints (optional) appli cant have to be captured electronically[3](#page-15-2) . This is done in accordance with [FM Category Acquisition Hardware](#page-38-2), [FM Category Acquisition Software](#page-42-0) and [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-43-1).

The resulting biometric data of the facial image and fingerprints can be reduced in size by lossy compression. However, multiple lossy compressions SHALL NOT be allowed. For facial images software-based quality as surance SHALL be conducted on the processed and compressed image data. For fingerprints, the compression SHALL be performed after the quality assurance process. The facial image and the fingerprint images as well as additional quality information, which is connected to the biometric data, SHALL be coded and then passed to the calling application.

Hereby, the facial image SHALL be passed to the calling application in two different encoding formats: The first format SHALL be used for storing the facial image in the passport, the second format SHALL be used for storing in a local reference storage ("Personalausweisregister", [\[BIB\\_PAuswG\],](#page-151-7) Â§23), refer to [FM COM-FI-](#page-54-3)[JPG](#page-54-3), [FM COM-FI-JP2](#page-54-2) and [FM COD-FI-GID](#page-70-0) for details on the encodings etc. The software-based quality assurance SHALL be conducted on basis of the processed and compressed images for storage on the chip of the identity card.

# 2.2.1.1 Overview Process

<span id="page-15-1"></span>[Figure 2.8](#page-15-1) depicts the biometric overview process of an application for a German Identity Card. The process depicted is for illustration purpose only. Note, that the following section will detail this process for fingerprint and facial image acquisition.

**Figure 2.8.** Overview Process Biometric Application German Identity Card

<span id="page-15-2"></span><sup>3</sup> Furthermore a signature is captured, too, but this is not part of the description within TR Biometrics.

# 2.2.1.2 Facial Image Acquisition Process

The facial image acquisition application system SHALL implement one ore more of the processes defined by the following subsections:

- 1. scan-of-photograph process
- 2. live-enrolment process
- 3. BSI [\[BIB\\_TR-03146\]](#page-151-3) digital-transmission process

In any case, a quality assurance module (software) SHALL be used in the facial image acquisition process. In case a facial image is deemed non-compliant by the quality assurance module, the official SHALL make a final decision regarding exceptions (based on legal rules) for further processing.

The final facial image SHALL be transferred to the calling application twice in different formats, one image to be stored within the passport chip, and the other facial image to be stored within the local reference storage ("Passregister", refer to [\[BIB\\_PAuswG\]](#page-151-7) Â§23). The software-based quality assurance SHALL be conducted on basis of the processed and compressed images for storage on the chip of the identity card.

### 2.2.1.2.1 Scan-of-Photograph Process

The facial image MAY be acquired by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official.

The photograph SHALL be compliant with the requirements for biometric images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-151-4). The offi cial manually verifies whether the photograph depicts the applicant. After the official visually inspected the facial image with the help of a photo guideline and, if needed, with the help of a photo template the facial image SHALL be scanned, refer to [FM QA-FI-PT](#page-45-0) and [FM QA-FI-PG.](#page-44-1) Afterwards, the facial image SHALL be processed by the quality assurance module (software).

<span id="page-16-0"></span>[Figure 2.9](#page-16-0) depicts the facial image acquisition process by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official. The process is defined in detail by [PAP ACQ-FI-SV-1: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition](#page-28-4) [by Scanned Image.](#page-28-4)

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>2.3 Application Profile German Electronic Residence Permit

The following Application Profile describes the application for a German Electronic Residence Permit.

The requirements for the application of a German Electronic Residence Permit are determined by the [\[BIB\\_AufenthG\]](#page-151-8), which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of German Electro nic Residence Permit. These requirements are based on [\[BIB\\_EC\\_1030\\_2002\].](#page-151-9)

By legal requirements, the inclusion of a facial image is mandatory, the inclusion of fingerprints for persons up to the age of six is not allowed but is mandatory for applicants older than six.

# 2.3.1 Mandatory Process

For the application of a German Electronic Residence Permit a facial image as well as two fingerprints of the applicant have to be captured electronically[5](#page-21-2) . This is done in accordance with [FM Category Acquisition](#page-38-2) [Hardware](#page-38-2), [FM Category Acquisition Software](#page-42-0) and [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-43-1).

The resulting biometric data of the facial image and fingerprints can be reduced in size by lossy compression. However, multiple lossy compressions SHALL NOT be allowed. For facial images software-based quality as surance SHALL be conducted on the processed and compressed image data. For fingerprints, the compression SHALL be performed after the quality assurance process. The facial image and the fingerprint images as well as additional quality information, which is connected to the biometric data, SHALL be coded and then passed to the calling application.

#### 2.3.1.1 Overview Process

<span id="page-21-1"></span>[Figure 2.15](#page-21-1) depicts the biometric overview process of an application for a German Residence Permit. The process depicted is for illustration purpose only. Note, that the following section will detail this process for fingerprint and facial image acquisition.

**Figure 2.15.** Overview Process Biometric Application German Electronic Residence Permit

# 2.3.1.2 Facial Image Acquisition Process

The facial image acquisition application system SHALL implement one ore more of the processes defined by the following subsections:

1. scan-of-photograph process

<span id="page-21-2"></span><sup>5</sup> Furthermore a signature is captured, too, but this is not part of the description within TR Biometrics.

- 2. live-enrolment process
- 3. BSI [\[BIB\\_TR-03146\]](#page-151-3) digital-transmission process

In any case, a quality assurance module (software) in the facial image acquisition process SHALL be used. In case a facial image is deemed non-compliant by the quality assurance module, the official SHALL make a final decision regarding exceptions (based on legal rules) for further processing.

#### 2.3.1.2.1 Scan-of-Photograph Process

The facial image MAY be acquired by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official.

The photograph SHALL be compliant with the requirements for biometric images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-151-4). The offi cial manually verifies whether the photograph depicts the applicant. After the official visually inspected the facial image with the help of a photo guideline and, if needed, with the help of a photo template the facial image SHALL be scanned, refer to [FM QA-FI-PT](#page-45-0) and [FM QA-FI-PG.](#page-44-1) Afterwards, the facial image SHALL be processed by the quality assurance module (software).

<span id="page-22-0"></span>[Figure 2.16](#page-22-0) depicts the facial image acquisition process by scanning a photograph which the applicant hands over to the official. The process is defined in detail by [PAP ACQ-FI-SV-1: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition](#page-28-4) [by Scanned Image.](#page-28-4)

![](_page_22_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 2.16.** Facial Image Acquisition Process by Scan of Photograph

#### 2.3.1.2.2 Live Enrolment Process

The facial image MAY be acquired live at a [SSS](#page-150-2) or in a studio set-up by the official.

# **Self-Service System**

[Figure 2.17](#page-23-0) depicts the overall facial image self-service acquisition process at the [SSS](#page-150-2) and the counter.

The facial image is acquired at the [SSS](#page-150-2). The official at the counter retrieves the acquired facial image.

At the counter, official SHALL verify acquired facial image is of applicant at counter. The soft ware based quality metrics SHALL be displayed to the official. The official SHALL decide to accept or reject the facial image, i.e. he MAY follow the quality software decision or MAY overrule a negative software [QA](#page-150-3) or MAY reject the facial image despite a positive software [QA.](#page-150-3)

[Section 4.5.2](#page-53-0) only applies for [SSS](#page-150-2) but not until May 2025.

The facial image acquisition process described by this section applies to supervised situations whe re the facial image is acquired by an operator scanning a printed image, refer to [Figure 3.1](#page-28-3).

A photo taken and printed by a photographer is provided by the biometric subject. At first, a visual check SHALL be performed by the operator, refer to [Section 4.7](#page-55-4) and [Section 4.4.](#page-44-0) The operator SHALL manually verify whether the photo depicts the biometric subject. Depending on the result of the visual inspection, the photo is rejected or accepted for further processing. In the successful case, the image SHALL be digitised with a scanner by the operator, refer to [Section 4.1](#page-38-2), [Section 4.2](#page-42-0) and [Section 4.3,](#page-43-1) and be compressed, refer to [Section 4.6.](#page-54-1) Afterwards, the scanned image SHALL be subject to quality assessment, refer to [Section 4.4](#page-44-0). Finally, the operator SHALL have the option, to give a veto in order to overrule the [QA](#page-150-3) software decision.

$$CTF = 3.04105 \cdot 10^{-4} \cdot f^2 - 7.99095 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot f + 1.02774 \tag{4.1}$$

<span id="page-40-1"></span>**â¢** 1000 ppi scanner, for f = 1.0 to 20.0 cy/mm:

$$CTF = -1.85487 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot f^3 + 1.41666 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot f^2 - 5.73701 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot f + 1.01341 \tag{4.2}$$

The standard which is relevant for the quality of facial images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\] hierarchically describes requi](#page-151-4) rements for the facial images. In the following, full frontal images are expected.

The [QA](#page-150-3) module SHALL analyse and evaluate all of the quality criteria listed in [Table 4.2](#page-46-1). For the criteria marked with "M", the quality values SHALL be provided while quality values for the criteria marked with "O" MAY be provided in the defined format according to the respective criteria.

A criterion is fulfilled if its calculated value is in the given threshold boundaries.

Based on the results of all provided quality criteria the [QA](#page-150-3) module SHALL reject or approve the picture. The total result is true if every single quality criteria is fulfilled.

The [QA](#page-150-3) module SHALL provide an interface for conformance testing where a single image (JPEG or JPEG2000 encoded) can be processed and the calculated values and configuration data are returned. The image type to process depends on the image type requirements of the application profile to implement.

**Table 4.2** Mapping of Relevant Quality Criteria

#### 4.4.3.1.2 Requirements Identification of the Best Capture

When multiple captures of facial images and their corresponding set of quality metrics are passed, the best capture of the captures SHALL be identified as described in the following:

- 1. If exactly one facial image conforms to more mandatory criteria than all other images, this image is chosen.
- 2. If no image is conform to more mandatory criteria than all other images, the last temporal image with the most fulfilled mandatory criteria is chosen among the facial images fulfilling the most criteria. If no

temporal information is available, a random selection SHALL be applied among the facial images fulfilling the most criteria

**Table 4.3** Quality Threshold Requirements for Facial Images for Enrolment Scenarios for Identity Documents

# <span id="page-48-1"></span>4.4.5 FM QA-FP-APP

This Function Module describes requirements for the quality assessment of plain or rolled fingerprints inclu ding quality assessment of single fingerprint, respectively slap and selection of the best quality image out of multiple instances.

# 4.4.5.1 Requirements

# 4.4.5.1.1 Quality Algorithm

As quality algorithm NFIQ 2.0 [\[BIB\\_NFIQ2.0\]](#page-151-11) SHALL be used. As resulting quality value, the output value of NFIQ 2.0 in the integer range of [0,100] SHALL be used. In the case of failure, the returned value 255 indicates that a computation was not successful. In this case, the value SHALL be returned as dedicated error code.

# 4.4.5.1.2 Quality Evaluation Process for a Slap or Single Fingerprint

In case a single captured fingerprint, respectively slap is passed, the [QA](#page-150-3) SHALL be performed as described in the following. Beforehand, the fingerprints of the passed capture SHALL be segmented (considering missing fingers). Note, that in verification applications, a [QA](#page-150-3) is not conducted. Thus, every slap capture is considered sufficient and no thresholds are specified here. Skipping the [QA](#page-150-3) is expected to accelerate the overall process. OPTIONALLY, a [QA](#page-150-3) can be performed.

- 1. For each segmented fingerprint *FA;j* of a passed capture *A*, a quality value *QA;j* is calculated with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 (up to 4 fingers in one slap) representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FIN](#page-151-6) [GER\].](#page-151-6)
- 2. The resulting quality value is compared with the defined threshold *T Hj* for this finger. The application specific thresholds as defined in the following section apply.
- 3. In case all of the fingerprint qualities reach the specified threshold (i.e. *8j; QA;j Â¸ T Hj* ), the boolean infor mation *b* = 1 indicates a successful capture.
- 4. In case one or more fingerprints do not reach the threshold (i.e. *9j; QA;j < T Hj* ), the boolean information *b* = 0 indicates insufficient quality of the capture.
- 5. For the segmented fingerprint *FA;j* the corresponding parameter set *PA;j* is compiled and returned.
- 6. As a result of the [QA](#page-150-3) process, the following values are returned to the calling process:

#### 4.4.5.1.3 Identification of the Best Capture out of Multiple Captures

When multiple captures *Ai ;i 2* 1*; :::; n* and their corresponding set of segmented fingerprints *FAi ;j* with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-151-6) are passed, the best of the captures SHALL be identified as described in the following section:

- 1. For each segmented fingerprint *FAi ;j* of a passed capture *Ai* , the quality value *QAi ;j* is calculated with re presenting the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-151-6).
- 2. The captures are ranked according to the quality values of the fingerprints according to the following (lexicographical) order. The highest ranked capture is considered as the capture yielding the best quality.
	- a. for left/right four-finger slaps, the order is as follows:
		- i. index finger (highest priority)
		- ii. middle finger
		- iii. ring finger
		- iv. little finger (lowest priority)

Example 1: Two Slaps of a right hand. Middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the first slap have a better quality than the middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the second slap, but the quality of the index finger is better in the second slap. Consequently, the second slap SHALL be taken.

Example 2: Three Slaps of a left hand. The quality of the index finger and the middle finger is the same in all three slaps, but the quality of the ring finger is better in the first slap. So the first slap SHALL be taken, no matter how high or low the quality of the little finger is in any slap.

- b. for thumb slaps, the order is as follows:
	- i. right thumb (highest priority)
	- ii. left thumb (lowest priority)
- c. for index finger slaps:
	- i. In contrast to the other two slap types, the best capture of index finger slaps is a set of the best captures of each index finger as indicated by the following two options.

If each index finger yields sufficient quality in at least one of the already conducted captures, the index fingers of sufficient quality are accepted and the total index finger slap capture is considered as of sufficient quality.

If not both index fingers yield at least once sufficient quality in a capture, the best image for each index finger is returned as the best capture and the slap captured is considered as of insufficient quality.

- ii. If for a single slap both index fingers yield to sufficient quality, those two index fingers SHALL be selected even if an index finger of another slap yield to better quality.
- d. for rolled single finger captures:
- i. Of the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand, which are not annotated by a hardware reported issue, the capture with the highest quality value is considered as the best image.
- ii. If the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand on does only contain images which are annotated by hardware reported issues, the capture with the highest quality value of the entire set is considered as the best image.
- iii. In case several captures yield to the same highest quality value, the last (temporal) of highest quality captures is considered as the best image.
- 3. As a result of the [QA](#page-150-3) process, the following values are returned:
	- a. the identifier *i* representing the capture yielding the best quality
	- b. the parameter set *PA* = *QAi;j ; QAi;l* with *j; l 2* 1*; :::*10.

The biometric data (zero, one or two fingers) SHALL be coded as a [Biometric Information Template \(BIT\)](#page-150-30) ac cording to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_19785-3\].](#page-151-17) The [BIT](#page-150-30) SHALL contain at least the fields header version, [Biometric Data Block](#page-150-31) [\(BDB\)](#page-150-31) Format Owner, [BDB](#page-150-31) Format Type, [BDB](#page-150-31) Biometric Type, and [BDB](#page-150-31) Biometric Subtype in the header and [BDB](#page-150-31) data according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]. The field for finger image quality information defined in \[ISO\\_FIN](#page-151-6) GER] SHALL be occupied with the result of the quality evaluation algorithm (of the selected fingerprint). The [BIT](#page-150-30) SHALL be encoded Base64 and stored in the output XML data.

Note, it SHALL be the task of the document producer to combine the [BIT](#page-150-30) into the data group 3 according to [\[BIB\\_ICAO\\_9303\]](#page-151-5).

# 4.12.2.2 Working Example

This working example ( [Table 4.8](#page-68-0)) gives an overview how a [WSQ](#page-150-13) image (containing the finger image) MAY be extracted by the application from the [BIT.](#page-150-30) The [BIT](#page-150-30) is composed of the [Biometric Header Template \(BHT\)](#page-150-32) and the [BDB](#page-150-31) containing the general record header, the finger image header record, and the finger image data. In the example "??" is representing a placeholder for a byte and <WSQ> is representing a placeholder for the actual fingerprint image).

# <span id="page-71-0"></span>4.13 FM Category Evaluation

This Function Module Evaluation contains methods and interfaces which are used in the scope of evaluation based on the specified log data of this Technical Guideline.

# 4.13.1 FM EVA-ALL-GENERIC

This Function Module defines general requirements for evaluations realized by plots, graphics and tables.

# 4.13.1.1 Requirements

The general requirements for plots, graphics, tables etc. defined in this module SHALL apply for all evaluations if not overruled by evaluation specific requirements.

# 4.13.1.2 Representation of Component Information

If an evaluation specification requires to use information of an XML-element of type type.component, e.g. for a software or hardware, a string concatenation of its child elements Vendor, Name, Version and FirmwareVersion SHALL be used to represent the XML-element of type type.component. If a child element is empty, this child element SHALL be excluded from the string representation.

If the child element ConfigurationInformation is used for the application, the configuration information SHALL be added to the string representation if reasonable for the specific evaluation e.g. if the configuration parameter may influence the aspects addressed by the specific evaluation.

The elements of the string representation SHALL be separated by ",".

# 4.13.1.3 Number and Date Formatting

The following applies for all numbers in plots, graphics and tables:

- **â¢** The "." or a blank SHALL be used as thousands separator.
- **â¢** The "," SHALL be used as decimal separator.
- **â¢** Small numerics, i.e. smaller than 10*Â¡*<sup>4</sup> , SHOULD be denoted in scientific notation e.g. 5*;* <sup>34</sup> *Â¢* <sup>10</sup>*Â¡*<sup>7</sup> .
- **â¢** Large numerics, i.e. bigger than 10 6 , SHOULD be denoted in scientific notation or by reasonable abbrevia tions e.g. "M" for million.
- **â¢** Decimal fractions SHOULD be rounded to not more than two digits.
- **â¢** Relative frequencies SHALL be noted as decimal.

The following applies for all numbers in tables:

Leading zeros in the table body's cells SHOULD be omitted for decimal fractions e.g. ".34" instead of "0.34".

The following applies for all dates in plots, graphics and tables:

- **â¢** The order of date components SHALL be (year, month, day). Note, that not all components are required.
- **â¢** Day, month and year components SHALL be numeric.

- **â¢** Years SHALL be presented by four digits.

# 4.13.1.4 Use of Colours

The following requirements apply for colours used in plots and graphics:

- **â¢** The used colours SALL be consistent over all plots and graphics generated. Colours SHALL be consistent over variable types, i.e. the same colour schema SHALL be used for the same variable type in different plots and graphics.
- **â¢** Colours commonly connoted with specific attributes SHALL be used only in coherence to the coloured object's meaning e.g. a plot or graphic object indicating an error fraction SHALL NOT be coloured green.
- **â¢** If no need to use more than one colour in a plot or graphic, e.g. to distinguish different types of plot elements by colour or to emphasis the denotation of an element by colour, the default colour SHOULD be black.

If more than one colour is used in a plot, a meaningful legend SHALL explain the applied colour schema.

Two RECOMMENDED colour palettes for e.g. line colours or stacked bar plot partitions are given in [Table 4.9](#page-72-0).

**Table 4.9** Recommended Colour Palettes

# 4.13.1.5 Definitions of Terms

The term "Geographic Region" SHALL be defined according to [\[BIB\\_UN REGIO\].](#page-151-18)

# 4.13.1.6 Trimmed Values

For trimming of values the following applies:

- **â¢** Trimming of values SHALL only be allowed for input variables of plots and graphics to e.g. remove outliers.
- **â¢** Trimming of values SHALL NOT be allowed for any kind of variables in table presentation, especially in lookup tables.
- **â¢** In case plot input variables have been trimmed, the trimming method and parameters as well as the number of excluded observation SHALL be denoted as remark at the resulting plot or graphic.
- **â¢** Trimming in context of this document refers to omitting the visualisation of the trimmed data e.g. for a box plot, the median and quartiles of the box SHALL still be calculated based on the total data but not on the trimmed data. However, the trimmed data points SHALL NOT be depicted in the box plot as outliers.

# 4.13.1.7 Plots, Graphics and Table in General

The following applies for all plots, graphics and tables:

**â¢** An explanatory description for each plot, graphic and table SHALL be given within a generated report.

- **â¢** Every plot, graphic or table SHALL have a meaningful caption or heading.
- **â¢** If finger codes are used, they SHALL be explained at the plot, graphic or table e.g. by a label or footnote.
- **â¢** The units of axis, cell values and other metrics SHALL be denoted either at each value or annotated as e.g. footnote or label of axis, rows, columns.

# 4.13.1.8 Plots and Graphics in General

The following applies for all plots and graphics:

# 4.13.1.9 Plots and Graphic Types

The following plot and graphic types MAY be used by evaluation modules. The subsequent general plot and graphic requirement applies if not otherwise specified by the specific evaluation.

#### 4.13.1.9.1 Pie Charts

It is RECOMMENDED to use stacked bar plots instead of pie charts.

#### 4.13.1.9.2 Heat Map

A heat map depicts the values of a matrix by colours. Thereby, the following applies:

The matrix cell values SHALL be mapped to a colour via two steps. Step 1 SHALL map every cell value to a value in the range [0,1]. Step 2 SHALL map every value within the range [0,1] to a heat colour. The exact computation SHALL be conducted in the following way:

- **â¢** Step 0
	- **â¢** If negative cell values are given in the relevant matrix, Step 0 SHALL be executed before the other Steps 1 and 2.
	- **â¢** Step 0 SHALL subtract from every cell value the minimum value of the column (case 1), the row (case 2) or of the whole matrix (case 3). In this way all values are mapped to non-negative numbers. Then all the other computations SHALL build on the non-negative cell values.
- **â¢** Step 1
	- **â¢** The matrix SHALL depict the values of the cells relatively to a given maximum value. Three types of modalities are possible: The cell values colours can orientate on
		- **â¢** the maximum value in their column (case 1) or
		- **â¢** the maximum value in their row (case 2) or
		- **â¢** the maximum value of the entire matrix (case 3).
	- **â¢** Which of the possible cases SHALL be considered is defined in specifications this Technical Gui deline for the respective heat map by the "Colour" attribute. It SHALL be visible to the viewer of heat map if the maximum of the columns, the rows or the entire table is considered. This can be done by a legend to the plot or a footnote.
	- **â¢** Every cell value SHALL be divided by â¦
- **â¢** the maximal value of the column (case 1)
- **â¢** the maximal value of the row (case 2)
- **â¢** the maximal value of the hole matrix (case 3)
- **â¢** In this way every cell SHALL be mapped to a value in the range [0,1]. Every maximal value SHALL be mapped to the value 1. Please note that this computation SHALL only be used to compute the heat map colour and SHALL NOT be used to label the cells itself (except for the case that it is the same value).
- **â¢** Step 2: The values derived in Step 1 SHALL be mapped to a colour following the mapping defined in [Ta](#page-74-0) [ble 4.10.](#page-74-0) Every maximal value of the column (case 1), of the row (case 2) or of the entire matrix (case 3) SHALL be coloured in #FF0000. Note, multiple maxima MAY be possible.

# 4.13.1.14.5 Top and Bottom Tables

A top or bottom table is a table, ordered by a set of value columns. The following applies:

- **â¢** "Value columns" SHALL be columns of the table which shall be considered and which are decisive for the ordering of the rows.
- **â¢** A fixed number of rows SHALL be present. If the number of rows to display is not defined by the evaluation, the default number SHALL be 20 rows.
- **â¢** In case of a top table, the table SHALL be ordered descending regarding the considered set of value columns and the row with the highest order SHALL be the first row of the table. In case of a bottom table, the table SHALL be ordered ascending by the set of value columns and the row with the lowest order SHALL be the first row of the table.
- **â¢** The ordering SHALL be conducted in the order of the value columns defined in the respective evaluation. In case of ties, the next value column of the set SHALL be evaluated.
- **â¢** If ties can not be resolved, the rank for same ranked rows SHALL be equal. The rank SHALL continue in the original order for following rows.
- **â¢** In case relative frequencies are in the set of value columns, a goodness indicator SHALL be present to esti mate the meaningfulness of the relative frequency i.e. the denominator of the relative frequency SHALL be the goodness estimator.
- **â¢** A rank column SHALL be present giving the rank of the record according to the ordering by the value columns.
- **â¢** The value columns SHALL be highlighted in the table header and a remark SHALL denote which columns are used for the ordering.
- **â¢** The ordering SHALL be unambiguous so that it is clear in which ordering the different rows appear in the table. This MAY be realised by ordering the rows by a name column. If the rows differ only by the name the rank SHALL be equal for all of those rows.

The top and bottom table is defined by the table definition in [Table 4.23](#page-88-0).
