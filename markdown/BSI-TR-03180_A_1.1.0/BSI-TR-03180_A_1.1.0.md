# 1 Introduction

This document describes which requirements a mobile (IT) device for the consumer market must fulfil (catalogue of requirements) and how the test of the requirements has to be performed (test specification) to qualify for an IT Security Label of the German Federal Office of Information Security (BSI).

Each requirement consists of a specific test property and a selection of permissible test methods for assessing the property. The purpose of specifying test properties is to enable objective testability in the context of issuing an IT Security Label. The aim is to ensure that the test results are independent of the person performing the test.

# 1.1 Target audience

The specifications in this document are intended for manufacturers of mobile IT devices for consumers to be used for the manufacturer's self-declaration when applying for an IT Security Label. They can also be used by manufacturers of mobile IT devices as part of a final or development-accompanying quality control or to define product characteristics as part of product development.

The document is also aimed at professional testers and evaluators. Ideally, the testers should be employees of testing bodies that are approved for testing/certification in accordance with the BSI Technical Guidelines.

The test results may be used as a supplement to inform the consumer as part of the device documentation.

# 1.2 Area of application

This document serves to determine the IT security level of mobile IT devices - especially smart phones and tablets – as part of the application for or granting of an IT Security Label.

The mobile IT device tested as part of the conformity assessment is referred to below as the "device under test" (DUT).

# 2 Scope of the Assessment

The following scope and assumptions based on the ETSI TS 103 732 [1] and TR-03180 [2] are used for the assessment of the security requirements set out in this document.

# 2.1 Target of evaluation

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) are the components of the DUT to which the requirements and test properties in this document apply. The composition of a mobile IT device can be generalised as follows:

![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the components of the TOE

What is part of the TOE?

- The hardware, e.g., SOC ("System on Chip"), touchscreen, sensors, interfaces.
- All software components that are intended/necessary for the →regular start and →regular operation of the mobile IT device and the proper use of apps.
- All apps that cannot be uninstalled by the user.
- The TOE includes the update services and the app distribution platform service of the device manufacturer and the operating system manufacturer, including the update services of their partners. However, only the parts that affect the integrity and authenticity of the provided or downloaded software on the server side and also on the mobile device side are considered.

• Software interfaces (APIs) via which components not belonging to the TOE (e.g., removable storage devices) are addressed are included in the analysis.

What is NOT part of the TOE?

- Hardware components that are not permanently installed in the mobile device, e.g., an SD memory card and the user data on it (the device manufacturer has no way of influencing this).
- SIM subsystem consisting of hardware (controller, antennas, etc.) and associated software components (data and SIM card applets).
- Secure Element (SE), as no threats/attacks are known in the context of this TR (→ mass attacks), therefore this document contains no specific requirements for secure elements. Although Secure Elements can be used to fulfil certain requirements in this document.
- Software components that realise are not part of a →regular start or →normal operation of the mobile IT device
- Apps that are present in the delivery state but can be uninstalled
- Apps that have been subsequently installed by the user.
- External services used by the TOE (exception: update service and app distribution platform of the device manufacturer).

# 2.2 State of the TOE

The assessment **MAY** be performed anytime independent of the device state (new, factory reset or in active use). A DUT **SHALL** always be able to conform to the requirements of this document, but **MAY** be able to violate the requirements temporarily because of an insecure user configuration.

For an assessment independent of possible insecure user configuration, the DUT **SHALL** be evaluated in the following state:

- New or factory reset device
- Initial device setup performed
- Updated to the newest software version

The DUT **SHALL** ensure that deviations from the requirements during the initial device setup are not possible.

# 2.3 Operating States

A mobile IT device can assume the following operating states:

#### **OFF**

The operating state OFF is assumed when no information technology processes are running. The status is reached when the power supply to the main processor is interrupted by the user by pressing the on/off switch (or a digital representation of it) or the power supply (here: battery) is exhausted.

In the operating state OFF, there is at most a basic power supply, for example to maintain the stored information or to control the restart of the device.

#### **ON**

The operating state ON is assumed as soon as or as long as the main processor is supplied with power and at least rudimentary information technology processes are running.

The operating state ON can be understood as a superordinate state to which all other operating states (SCB, SIMPIN, DEVPIN, UNLOCK, LOCK and MAIN) can be subsumed.

#### **SCB - Secure Boot**

In this operating state, the device starts from the OFF state to a state in which the first user interaction is requested.

#### **SIMPIN - Before entering the SIM PIN**

This operating status can only be entered if a PIN has been set to control access to the SIM functions.

Note: This operating state is not considered further, as the SIM subsystem is outside the TOE - and is therefore also missing from the state transition diagram.

#### **DEVPIN - Before entering the device PIN for the first time**

This operating state can only be entered if a PIN or password has been set to control access to the device functions.

#### **UNLOCK – Unlocked**

When unlocked, all device functions are available to the user.

#### **LOCK – Locked**

When locked, the user's interaction with apps is interrupted, but the user is still logged in. However, the user interface allows limited device operation or use, such as making emergency calls and cancelling phone numbers from the contacts, controlling a music player and the alarm function of the alarm clock or calendar. If one or more authentication methods (knowledge, possession, biometrics) have been defined, the user can only continue working with apps after re-authentication.

#### **MAIN - Maintenance mode**

In maintenance mode, a kernel is loaded that is independent of the operating system and allows write access to the operating system partition. It is usually entered after the user has triggered an operating system update in the Unlocked state.

The state transitions are defined as follows:

![](_page_6_Figure_11.jpeg)

Figure 2: Transitions between the operating states of the TOE

The →Recovery mode is not regarded as separate operating state in the sense of this TR.

# 2.4 Assets

Assets worthy of protection can be both direct and indirect. Indirectly protected assets are generally valid and not directly related to the TOE (e.g., operating system, updates and configurations). In contrast, direct data worthy of protection is related to the TOE, for example user data.

The assets worthy of protection include in particular

- Data / app data
- Information about the installed apps
- User data (examples: Files, location data, account information, communication data, user login name, sensor data, clipboard data, ...)
- Usage data of apps and the OS (examples: time the app was started, programme parts clicked, etc.)
- TOE operating system and apps
- Updates
- Configuration of security functions

The following protection classes are distinguished for the data:

000 Disclosure, falsification or unavailability of the data is of no significance either to its owner or to its user(s).

- 001 The unavailability of the data is a risk for its owner or user(s).
- 010 The falsification of the data is a danger to its owner or user(s).
- 100 Disclosure of the data is a danger to its owner or user(s).
- 999 The data is part of the TOE security system.

The security system of the TOE consists of both functional features of the TOE (e.g., rights management) and critical user data (e.g., key material or biometric data of fingerprints and facial recognition).

The data for protection class 999 includes

- Character combinations that are uniquely linked to a device
- Keys, certificates and/or other data used for the initial integrity check at system start up
- Keys, certificates and/or other data used to verify the integrity and authenticity of updates

Combinations of protection classes are possible:

011 Data with the properties of protection classes 001 and 010:

Both the falsification and the unavailability of the data are a danger for their owner or user(s).

101 Data with the properties of protection classes 001 and 100:

Both the disclosure and the unavailability of the data are a risk for their owner or user(s).

110 Data with the properties of protection classes 010 and 100: Both disclosure and falsification of the data are a danger to their owner or user(s)

111 Data with the properties of protection classes 001, 010 and 100: Both the disclosure and the falsification as well as the unavailability of the data are a danger for their owner or their user(s).

# 2.5 General Assumptions

The following assumptions are necessary for interpreting the security requirements and to perform the conformity assessment of the DUT:

- The manufacturer of the mobile IT device is assumed to be trustworthy and there is no additional need to protect the user from the manufacturer as a potential attacker.
- Mobile IT devices in the scope of this document are primarily operated in a personal context and not suitable for business related usage
- Users are not necessarily handling their personal data with sufficient care. Although they regard their data as valuable, users might be prone to favour comfort over security by ignoring warnings, delaying security updates, etc …
- Users do not share their mobile IT device with other users. Consequently, security concerns regarding multi-user usage are not considered.

# 2.6 Assumed Threats and Threat Agents

During the evaluation of the DUT some tests require the assessment if a given property or attack vector is not possible, e.g., is not possible for apps to access data without permission of the user. For the scope of the assessment the threat agents following ETSI TS 103 732 [1] are assumed.

Threat Agents:

- TA.LOCAL: a threat agent in the general vicinity of a TOE when it is used, and therefore has access to the local wireless interface.
- TA.REMOTE: a threat agent with access to the wide-area interface.
- TA.PHYSICAL: a threat agent who has physical access to the TOE, and therefore to both the user interface and the physical interface.
- TA.FLAWAPP: a malicious or poorly programmed app that the human user has installed on the TOE and that therefore has access to the application interface, and possibly to the local wireless interface and/or the wide-area network interface.

NOTE: The same person or entity can be multiple threat agents simultaneously.

Threat Agents are limited to the potential for simple attacks, i.e., easily performed local attacks on a single device, and mass attacks, widely used remote attacks not targeting a specific victim.

The security requirements and their assessment are based on possible threats caused by the threat agents. The following threats are assumed:

T.EAVESDROP: TA.LOCAL, TA.REMOTE or TA.FLAWAPP read communication between the TOE and other

entities and thereby access confidential user data assets in transit.

T.SPOOF: TA.LOCAL or TA.REMOTE create a spoofed device or service and wait for the TOE to connect to that device or service. Once the TOE connects to the spoofed device or service the threat agents actively or passively extract user data assets from the TOE.

T.MODIFY-COMMS: TA.LOCAL or TA.REMOTE initiate or intercept communication between the TOE and other entities and thereby modify user data assets in transit.

T.COUNTERFEIT\_DEVICE: TA.PHYSICAL or TA.LOCAL attempts to connect to the TOE and thereby gain

access to user data assets with a device masquerading as a trusted peer device.

T.IMPERSONATE - TA.PHYSICAL impersonates the legitimate user of the TOE thereby gaining access to the User Data Assets.

T.PHYSICAL - TA.PHYSICAL attempts to gain access to assets by accessing physical interfaces of the TOE.

T.RECOVER\_DATA - A human user sells their TOE and attempts to remove all user data assets beforehand, but the new user (TA.PHYSICAL) is still able to retrieve some or all of these user data assets.

T.MODIFY\_DEVICE - TA.PHYSICAL obtains a TOE, modifies that TOE, and reinserts that TOE into the supply

chain. Later on a legitimate human user buys this CMD and the modified CMD allows compromise of the assets of that user.

T.FLAWAPP-ACCESS - TA.FLAWAPP attempts to access to user data assets that it should not be able to access and subsequently modify them or export them to third parties. This includes additional data gathered from the TOE sensors (GPS, camera, microphone, etc.).

T.PERSISTENT - Successful realisation of one of the other threats can lead to a persistent presence on the TOE

constituting an ongoing threat in itself. The threat agent associated with the other threat can possibly control the device.

T.NEW\_ATTACKS - Any of the threat agents can make use of newly discovered vulnerabilities in the TOE and

thereby becomes able to execute one or more of the other threats.

T.FLAWAPP\_HACKS\_TOE - TA.FLAWAPP attempts to modify the security behaviour of the TOE.

T.FLAWAPP\_HACKS\_OTHER\_APPS - TA.FLAWAPP attempts to modify the behaviour of other apps, without

access permission to the peer app being granted through the operating system or the peer app.

# 3 Assessment Procedure

This document defines requirements based on a selection of security criteria from ETSI TS 103 732 [1] in conjunction with BSI TR-03180 [2] as well asthe currently known state of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) that are considered relevant for the area of application (see section 1.2).

Each requirement contains one **test property** and a selection of**test methods.** The **test property** specifies the requirement and defines its requirement level. In order to evaluate the **test property** in a well-founded manner, **test methods** of different test depths must be used to assess the conformity. For each **test property**, this test specification specifies which **test methods** are permissible or appropriate.

Using an authorised test method, the assessment of each test property leads to a "Pass" or "Fail" **verdict** for this test property. To derive the cumulative test result, see section 3.3

The testing of the requirements refers to the part of the test object defined by the TOE (See 2.1)

# 3.1 Types of requirements

Requirements in this document are sorted into different categories:

• Baseline Requirements: Requirements directly derived from TS 103 732 [1] or another baseline standard.

These requirements can be substituted with corresponding baseline standard and the corresponding assessment. The corresponding standard is indicated with "Referenced standard".

- Additional CRA Requirements (Marked as "CRA"): Requirements added to prepare for potential requirements of the upcoming European legislation Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)
- Additional IT Security Label Requirements (Marked as "ISL"): Additional requirements added for the consumer context of the IT Security Label
- Additional optional Requirements (Marked as "OPT"): The optional requirements may be tested by the manufacturer, but are not required for eligibility for the IT Security Label. These requirements may be used by the manufacturers to differentiate themselves.

To be eligible for the IT Security Label the manufacturer may skip OPT requirements.

# 3.2 Roles

The conformity assessment requires the following roles:

- Manufacturer: The manufacturer accountable for the device, i.e., the manufacturer putting the device on the market under his own name. The manufacturer is able to delegate parts of production or development to external suppliers. In this case the manufacturer is responsible that the outsourced components of the DUT adhere to the security requirements set out in this document. This includes technical requirements as well as requirements for processes. The manufacturer is responsible to provide the Tester with documentation required for the assessment.
- Tester: The tester assessing the conformity of the DUT to this catalogue. The conformity assessment MAY be performed by the manufacturer itself or a testing laboratory on behalf of the manufacturer.

# 3.3 Test results

The tester must answer the question whether a test property is met by the DUT as "True" or "False". If the tester cannot come to a clear test result, the test property is deemed to be "Inconclusive".

For each test property, this test specification defines the requirement level, which determines which test result leads to a "Pass" verdict and which to a "Fail" verdict.

If the DUT does not have certain technical features (such as cameras, a USB port, optional wireless interfaces such as NFC, WLAN or Bluetooth and a fingerprint sensor) or if it does not have a functionality (such as restricting access to objects to "write only" as addressed in DAT\_BER.1.3c), a test property aimed at these functionalities cannot be tested. This leads to the verdict "not applicable" for the respective test property.

The verdicts result from the correlation "test result – requirement level" as follows:

| Requirement<br>level                                  | Test property | Test property | Test property | Test property  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
|                                                       | True          | False         | Inconclusive  | Not testable   |
| SHALL (NOT)                                           | Pass          | Fail          | Fail          | not applicable |
| SHOULD (NOT)<br>Without (sufficient)<br>justification | Pass          | Fail          | Fail          | not applicable |
| SHOULD (NOT)<br>With sufficient<br>justification      | Pass          | Pass          | Fail          | not applicable |
| MAY                                                   | Pass          | Pass          | Pass          | not applicable |
| CAN                                                   | Pass          | Pass          | Pass          | not applicable |

Some test properties do not refer to the DUT in general, but to apps belonging to the DUT. These are apps that cannot be uninstalled by the user. These apps are usually part of the delivery state of the DUT.

If the DUT deviates from a test property with the requirement level **SHOULD** or **SHOULD NOT**, the tester must evaluate the manufacturer's justification for the deviation to determine whether it can convince him that the deviation leads to a solution that is equal/equivalent to the test property. If the justification is convincing, the verdict is "passed"; if it is not convincing or if there is no justification, the verdict is "failed".

The cumulative test result for all test properties of a requirement is "failed" as soon as at least one of the test properties has been assessed as "failed". The overall verdict is "failed" as soon as one criterion has been "failed".

The cumulative test result across all test properties of a requirement is "passed" if all test properties have been assessed as "passed" or "not applicable". In contrast, a criterion is considered "not applicable" if all of its associated test properties are "not applicable".

The overall verdict is "passed" if all requirements have been assessed as "passed" or "not applicable".

# 3.4 Test methods

There is a set of test methods that are generally applicable when assessing test properties. The set can be divided into two groups:

- Methods for the evaluation of technical properties
- Methods for the evaluation of business processes (at the manufacturer of the DUT)

The test methods for business processes and technical properties differ in their individual test depth ranging from T/P.0 to T/P.3 as shown below.

# 3.4.1 Technical Test Methods

#### **T.3 - Evaluation of implementation details**

This evaluation method requires a deep understanding of the product and is primarily intended for a selfassessment by the manufacturer in possession of necessary implementation details, like source code, configuration files or unit tests.

An external tester will require knowledge about the implementation details of a specific function or the complete product to use this test method

#### **T.2 - Investigation of device behaviour (manual or automated)**

The aim of this test method is to determine the extent to which the DUT behaves in accordance with its

functional description or the extent to which the DUT exhibits undesirable behaviour outside of regular or rule-compliant use/operation by testing control cases and limit cases.

The manual examination typically takes place using the on-board resources of the DUT, such as the system settings or the connection configuration.

The automated assessment may, involve for example the use of a special app that behaves like a malicious app and attempts to undermine the security system of the test subject.

#### **T.1 -Investigation of device behaviour (manual or automated)**:

It should be noted that the developer documentation is not limited to the parts that the device manufacturer has produced (itself). In principle, it also includes the documentation of OEMs or developers of components that the device manufacturer has installed without further adaptation/modification.

In addition to the manufacturer or developer documentation, further documentation can be used to process the test property. This typically includes

- Norms, standards, etc. on the subject area of the respective requirement
- Research results of scientific institutions
- Papers in relevant specialist journals

Presentations on specialised websites (less: forums, chat groups, social media channels)

#### **T.0 - Manufacturer's declaration**

Statements made by the manufacturer on the properties of the DUT during the test (possibly at the request of the tester) can be used as a source of information. However, the information must be assessed by the tester, in particular with regard to its credibility and plausibility. Manufacturer information that appears unreliably or implausible to the tester may not be used to derive the test opinion.

# 3.4.2 Process Test Methods

#### **P.3 - Analysis of the manufacturer's process definition:**

From the point of view of the reliability of the test results, this test specification classifies the documentation of the manufacturer's business processes in the same way as the source code with regard to their significance for the DUT, but with the restriction that the source code definitely determines the behaviour of the DUT, while the documentation of the business processes cannot guarantee that these are also implemented/lived accordingly. Against the background of today's compliance requirements and efforts, this document assumes in favour of the manufacturer that it does not - at least not wilfully - incorrectly document/describe its business processes.

#### **P.2 Retrospective and prospective assessment of manufacturer behaviour:**

The test result from the observation and evaluation of the actual manufacturer behaviour is comparable to the investigation of the device behaviour (T.2). It is usually based on the manufacturer's behaviour in the past (retrospective), but can also be carried out for current periods, starting with the testing process.

#### **P.0 Manufacturer's declaration:**

Statements made by the manufacturer on the properties of the DUT during the test (possibly at the request of the tester) can be used as a source of information. However, the information must be assessed by the tester, in particular with regard to its credibility and plausibility. Manufacturer information that appears to the tester to be untrustworthy or implausible shall not be used to derive the test opinion.

# 3.4.3 Permissible Test Methods

Each test property defines one or more permissible test methods. The tester **SHALL** use at least one of these defined test methods, but may also use a combination of the permissible test methods.

If the test is carried out by the manufacturer itself (i.e. without the use of manufacturer-independent third parties), the test depth T.0 or P.0 (manufacturer's declaration) is not sufficient.

If a test property cannot be tested in a specific case using a listed test method (although the DUT has the technical features or functionalities relevant for the test properties), the next higher test method **SHALL** be used until the test property can be tested. If none of the permitted test methods is suitable for testing a test property in a specific case, the test property **SHALL** be treated as "inconclusive".

The tester **SHALL** only use information available or submitted to him/her (e.g., source code, developer documentation, etc.) to derive the test result, if

- their completeness,
- their plausibility,
- their topicality,
- their truthfulness and
- their relevance (with regard to the DUT and the examination)

is ensured.

# 3.5 Special Terms

The Tester **SHALL** interpret the following terms accordingly:

- Acknowledged rules of technology: The requirement has to be implemented according to what is considered good and common practice in the industry. For cryptography following the acknowledged rules of technology common and well-known cryptographic references **SHALL** be used, i.e., BSI TR 02102 [3], SOG-IS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms [4] or comparable public references meeting the ISO/IEC 18033-1 ANNEX A [5] requirements for new ciphers. Generally, cryptographic mechanisms which are susceptible to attacks possible with widely available technology and are unable to uphold their respective security function are considered deprecated and not within the acknowledged rules of technology.
- Without undue delay: The action required has to be performed as soon as possible. The tester **SHALL** assess whether, the requested action was performed in a time not substantially longer than necessary for the specific scenario. For comparison other similar real-life scenarios **MAY** be used. When in doubt the tester **MAY** request additional information from the manufacturer, to justify any delays and ascertain that the manufacturer acted as soon as possible.
- "Not" able, possible, etc.: For some requirements the tester has to assessthatit is not possible to bypass an implemented security function. In this scenario the Tester **SHALL** act according to the assumed Threat Agents (cf. 2.6) with an attacker potential for simple attacks, i.e., easily performed local attacks on a single device, and mass attacks, widely used remote attacks not targeting a specific victim.
- Document and publish: If a requirement states that something must be documented, this means that the manufacturer possesses a record which is not necessarily available for public access. Publish means that something is documented and available for public access.

# 3.6 Test documentation

In accordance with the BSI's "Application notes and interpretations of the scheme" (AIS) on the subject of "Requirements for the structure and content of ETR parts for evaluations according to CC" [6], each individual verdict must be documented in a comprehensible manner. This documentation **SHALL** include at least the following information:

- 1. Title
- 2. Version
- 3. Date of last change
- 4. Identity of the testing body (e.g., company name of the manufacturer, company name of a testing centre)
- 5. Name of the author(s) of the test report
- 6. Name of the responsible tester
- 7. Named list of persons involved in the test and their respective roles in the test
- 8. Name of the person responsible for the review of the test report
- 9. Date of the start and end of the test

For the DUT

- 1. Name of the manufacturer
- 2. Contact address of the manufacturer
- 3. Contact person at the manufacturer
- 4. Sales description/model name
- 5. Unique model number
- 6. Operating system version
- 7. Kernel version (if available)

For each test property

- 1. Evaluation of the functionality under consideration
- 2. Test method used
- 3. Test result ("Applies", "Does not apply")
- 4. Justification for the derivation of the test result from the assessment (where appropriate, also by explaining why the assessment does not allow the derivation of the opposite test result)
- 5. Verdict ("fail", "pass" or "not applicable") derived from the test result
- 6. Reasons for a verdict that deviates from the test result (for target and target not) and for nonapplicable test properties

The protocol template in Appendix A of this document should be used to document the test properties.

# 3.7 Reuse of Evidences

For composition evidences from assessment based on other standards may be used. To reuse evidences the Test **SHALL** assess if the evidence is appropriate to meet the test property and meets the requirement for the approved test methods.

Generally, test properties based on baseline standards are compatible with the referenced standard. Evidences used and results generated for the baseline standard MAY be reused for the assessment of this guideline.

# 5 Modal verbs

The document uses the modal verbs (**MAY, SHOULD, SHALL**, etc.) in the definition according to IETF RFC 2119 [17] as follows for the "requirement (level)" specified in the area of the application of the test properties:

## **SHALL**

These terms mean that there is no alternative to (positive) proof of the test property or its fulfilment.

## **SHALL NOT**

These expressions characterise test properties that the DUT does not exhibit in any (absolute) case, not even in a modified form, i.e., deviations or workarounds are not permitted.

## **SHOULD**

In duly justified cases, it is permitted that the product characteristics of the DUT do not correspond 1:1 to the test characteristics. The justification must show that the manufacturer of the DUT has understood and carefully considered the implications associated with the deviation.

### **SHOULD NOT**

Analogous to **SHOULD**, these terms mean that a deviation is permissible in duly justified cases. Here too, the justification must show that the manufacturer of the DUT has understood and carefully weighed up the implications associated with the deviation.

### **MAY/CAN**

These terms characterise test properties whose fulfilment is actually voluntary in every respect.

# 6 Glossary

### **Acknowledged rules of technology / Good Practice**

Common realisation of technical issues in practice and considered as adequate solution for a given problem, a subset of the →state of the art.

### **Attacker**

A third party who has the intention of gaining unauthorised access to an IT system. This access can be targeted and non-targeted.

#### **App**

A programme (application, application software) with a user interface that can be (subsequently) installed on a mobile device and extends the functionality of the device beyond the pure operating system functionalities.

### **Best Practice**

See "State of the art"

#### **Bootloader**

A programme that is located in the →bootstrap between the boot ROM code and the kernel of the →operating system of an IT device. It is characterised in particular by the use of an abstract programming language and the ability to check and evaluate the integrity and authenticity of the processes and programs to be called or activated in the further course of the bootstrap.

#### **Bootstrap/Bootstrapping**

The process of gradually executing increasingly complex programme structures in an IT system after the purely electro technical process of switching it on (closing an electrical contact and thus supplying an electronic component with power) until the system finally runs with an elaborate →operating system that, in addition to controlling the hardware, also enables user interactions and implements protective measures such as user administration, is known as bootstrapping. Bootstrapping begins with mobile IT devices, as with classic IT devices, with an unchangeable, machine-oriented code that is stored in the ROM of the device (often called "boot ROM code"). This code is activated by electrical circuits and can already access the device storage, perform calculations with storage contents (data) and skip or execute programme steps depending on the data. The task of this code is "only" to localise and call the so-called →bootloader in the device storage, which then takes over further control of the bootstrap.

#### **Delivery state**

See original condition

#### **Device ID**

A character string for identifying a specific mobile IT device that the user cannot influence, i.e., change or delete. Several device IDs can be assigned to a mobile IT device at the same time for different requirements. Typical device IDs are: IMEI2, serial number, MAC address, etc.

#### **Device storage**

The internal non-volatile storage

#### **Delete**

Deletion in the sense of this TR means the irretrievable deprivation of access to data. This deletion can take place either by physical ("real") removal of the data from the system (by overwriting with zero information or random data) or by logical deletion of the reference points to data (e.g., by removing the start address of the files in an allocation table).

In the case of encrypted data, it may be sufficient to delete the encryption key alone in order to delete the data.

#### **Entity**

A neutral term for (usually external) individual devices, information infrastructures, users, etc., with which a mobile IT device establishes or maintains a (communication) relationship. An entity can have a more or less complex technical structure and a more or less pronounced computing power/intelligence.

#### **EOL**

The "end of life" (EOL) of technical devices is the point at which the manufacturer stops supplying spare parts and updates.

#### **Good Practice**

See Acknowledged Rules of Technology

#### **Factory state/factory reset**

As a rule, the user has the option of resetting a mobile IT device to its factory settings ("factory reset").

A reset to the factory settings deletes all user data and restores the device to a "delivery-like" state. Operating system updates carried out in the meantime are not cancelled, which means that the factory state does not correspond to the →original state. In this respect, the usual term "factory reset" is misleading, as the factory settings are not restored.

#### **Operating system (OS)**

Together with the underlying hardware, an operating system provides a runtime environment for programmes (or apps) that are used by the user. Operating systems usually consist of several software layers (e.g., the kernel, hardware drivers, etc.), which control access to the hardware (camera, fingerprint sensor, etc.), as well as many other components (e.g., services) and software interfaces for the programmes. In the case of mobile devices, the "operating system" also includes external services such as the update service or services from a manufacturer (in the case of Android, often Google services). Manufacturers also like to enrich their devices with their own apps. However, this should no longer be referred to as an "operating system", but as a "distribution".

#### **Original condition**

The device status immediately after purchase, i.e., without any configuration or functional changes by the user. As soon as an operating system update has been carried out on the device, the original status can no longer be restored.

The original condition can also be referred to as the delivery condition.

See also factory settings.

#### **Pairing**

The initial pairing of two Bluetooth devices to establish a security relationship, which the user must confirm manually. After the pairing process, the two devices can be connected automatically.

#### **Pseudonyms ID**

A character string that makes a specific mobile IT device identifiable and which, in contrast to the device ID, the user can influence, i.e., change or delete, at will. Several pseudonymous IDs can be assigned to a mobile IT device at the same time for different needs.

#### **Recovery mode**

A special state outside of →regular operation in which administrative activities such as

- Restore
- Repair
- Delete user data ("wipe")

can be executed. Recovery mode is not part of the "private use" usage scenario (see footnote 1 in chapter 1) and is therefore not considered further in this TR.

#### **Regular operation**

In the consumer world, mobile IT devices are usually operated with the operating system (OS) (pre-)installed by the device manufacturer - even if it is usually technically possible to operate an alternative OS (or operating system setup) on the hardware of a specific device (so-called "custom ROM"). This use is referred to as regular operation in this TR. The →bootloader supplied by the device manufacturer ensures that the device is only started in regular mode.

The installation of a custom ROM - and thus the uninstallation of the OS (pre-)installed by the device manufacturer - cannot usually be carried out during regular operation, but must be done by intervening in the process for starting the device, during which the control function of the bootloader is deactivated (the socalled "unlocking" of the bootloader).

#### **Regular start**

See "Regular operation"

#### **Simple attack**

An attack by means of physical access (e.g., access to a found or stolen device) to the device using comparatively simple attack techniques (trying out, inspecting, etc. the device), with which the attacker is successful with little time expenditure; it can also be associated with targeted intentions to harm the owner or legitimate user of the device (known to the perpetrator).

#### **Maintenance mode**

The device state that results from booting into an alternative kernel that is independent of the operating system. This allows the operating system partition to be repaired or changed.

#### **Mass attack**

Attacks without physical access to the device and without person-specific (i.e., without reference to a specific person) or device-specific (i.e., without reference to a physically specific device) intentions to cause damage.

#### **State of the art**

The state of the art reflects the technically realisable state of development of a technology. As a rule, it is technically more far-reaching than the → acknowledged rules of technology (see above).

#### **Status display / status bar**

Technical devices with a screen often signal the status of certain components on the screen in the so-called "status bar". This is usually located at the top of the screen on smartphones and tablets and contains, for example, the time and icons for the battery charge status, Wi-Fi and mobile phone connection quality, camera and microphone usage, etc.

#### **Users**

The human user who operates the mobile IT device. This is to be distinguished from the user account ("user"), which is the digital representation of the user on the device.

#### **Vulnerability**

Vulnerabilities within the meaning of this TR are only those found in the software of the TOE.

#### **Without (undue) delay**

Without (undue) delay does not necessarily mean "immediately", but "as soon as possible". In the case of updates to close a vulnerability, for example, it may be necessary to carry out time-consuming quality checks before delivering the update so that the update cannot be made available "on the same day" or "12 hours later". However, an unnecessary extension of the quality checks in this case would be a culpable delay.
