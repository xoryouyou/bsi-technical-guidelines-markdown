# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**1. Volume German Identity Documents**

This document defines Application Profiles, Function Modules and processes for the enrolment of biometric data for specific [German Identity Documents \(GID\)](#page-86-1), namely

- **â¢** the German Electronic Passport (including temporary passports),
- **â¢** the German Identity Card (including temporary identity cards and replacement identity cards) and
- **â¢** the German Electronic Residence Permit (including residence cards, permanent cards and tem porary residence permit documents).

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2. Basics for German Identity Documents**

This chapter defines basics for the enrolment of biometric data specific German Identity Documents, na mely the German Electronic Passport, the German Identity Card and the German Electronic Residence Permit.

# <span id="page-7-4"></span><span id="page-7-1"></span>**2.1. Legal Requirements**

The requirements for the application of a German Electronic Passport are determined by the [\[BIB\\_PassG\]](#page-88-1), which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of the German Electronic Passport. These requirements are based on the EU regulation 2252/2004, refer to [\[BIB\\_EC\\_2252/2004\]](#page-88-2).

The requirements for the application of an electronic German Identity Card are determined by the [\[BIB\\_PAuswG\]](#page-88-3), which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of the German Identity Card. These requirements are based on the EU regulation 2019/1157, refer to [\[BIB\\_EU\\_2019/1157\]](#page-88-4).

The requirements for the application of a German Electronic Residence Permit are determined by the [\[BIB\\_AufenthG\]](#page-88-5), which mandates biometric characteristics to be included in the chip of the German Electronic Residence Permit. These requirements are based on the EU regulation 1030/2002, refer to [\[BIB\\_EC\\_1030\\_2002\]](#page-88-6).

By legal requirements, the inclusion of a facial image is mandatory. The inclusion of fingerprints for persons up to the age of five is not allowed, but is mandatory for applicants from the age of six years and older.

# <span id="page-7-2"></span>**2.2. Relevant Standards and Conditions**

In addition to the legal requirements ( [Section 2.1\)](#page-7-4), further basic directives and standards SHALL be applied:

- **â¢** [\[BIB\\_ICAO\\_9303\]](#page-88-7)
- **â¢** [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-88-8)
- **â¢** [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9)

# <span id="page-7-3"></span>**2.3. Overview Process**

For the acquisition of biometric data required for a German Identity Document it depends on the agency which application profiles are implemented locally. For the acquisition and the subsequent enrolment for a German Identity Document at least one application profile for the facial image acquisition at the counter and the application profile for the fingerprint acquisition at the counter have to be implemented. Note that additional application profiles MAY be used, such as for example unsupervised acquisition with Self-Service Systems but a manual acquisition of both, facial images and fingerprints, SHALL always be possible to allow for a manual intervention by the official.

The biometric data selection takes place at the counter. This procedure always includes quality as sessment for facial images, possibly in addition to quality assessment done during the acquisition process. For fingerprints, quality assessment is only done during enrolment but not necessary within the acquisition pro cess done for control verification. For a successful acquisition and enrolment the overview process from the biometric point of view is depicted in [Figure 2.1](#page-8-0).

A copy of the facial image is stored within the Register of Documents ("Pass- und Personalausweisregister"). The biometric data (facial image and fingerprints if applicable) are then transferred to the central Document Production.

For facial images, live enrolment SHALL be the primary source for acquisition from 1st May 2025 on. Scanning of photographs MAY only take place in special cases which are defined by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and within German represenations abroad only.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2.1.** Overview Process

The application profiles marked orange do not take place in the agency. The application profile marked in red is only allowed in special use cases (refer to [Application Profile Facial Image Delivery by Scan of Photograph\)](#page-17-1).

When Application Profiles or Partial Processes are combined in an application, redundant pro cesses and operations MAY be reduced to one. These processes and operations SHALL then be combined at the point where they occur first, e.g. if an algorithm for quality assessment with the same configuration respective threshold values and the same input (i.e. unchanged image) is called again, it SHALL not be executed again.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**2.4. Sources of Facial Images**

With regard to facial images, this Technical Guideline distinguishes between the following types:

- **â¢** "live images": Facial images that have been acquired live within the authority (supervised or unsupervised) where the acquisition process is handled via a process in this TR.
- **â¢** "delivered images": Facial images that have been acquired using equipment outside the agency's network. These are in turn divided into:
	- **â¢** "cloud images": Facial images that were acquired by a facial image service provider in a studio set-up outside of the agency and sent to the agency electronically via a cloud solution (refer to [Application](#page-16-0) [Profile Facial Image Digital Delivery via Cloud \(BSI TR-03170\)](#page-16-0)).
	- **â¢** "scanned images": Facial images that were scanned from a passport photo within the agency. Note, that scanning is only applicable in a few special cases (refer to [Application Profile Facial Image Delivery by](#page-17-1) [Scan of Photograph](#page-17-1)).
	- **â¢** "digital camera images": Facial images that were taken by an agency's operator (official) with a digital camera that is detached from the operator's application. Note, this type of delivery only applica ble in a few special cases (refer to [Application Profile Facial Image Digital Delivery by Digital Camera\)](#page-14-0). However, if the digital camera is attached to operator's application and operated through this ap plication, [Application Profile Supervised Basic Facial Image Acquisition System](#page-12-0) applies (which is then not a delivered image).

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**3.4. Application Profile Facial Image Digital Delivery by Digital Camera**

This Application Profile is only applicable in a few specific use cases, in which an automated acquisition is not possible or the application scenario is excluded from the underlying legal specifications:

- **â¢** Capturing of facial images within German representations abroad.
- **â¢** Capturing of facial images by German officials outside the agency ("BÃ¼rgerkoffer").
- **â¢** Capturing of facial images by German officials inside the agency as fall-back scenario in case, automated equipment cannot be used (e.g. due to failures or if applicants cannot be captured automatically due to medical reasons).

The special cases, in which this Application Profile is applicable, are defined by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior.

Within this application profile the supervised manual facial image acquisition with a digital camera is speci fied. The facial image acquisition system is used to manually capture facial images with a digital camera that is detached from the operators application in the moment of capturing. Note, that the operator MAY acquire more than one facial image (per session) to increase the likelihood of having at least suf ficient quality.

The captured facial images are loaded into the operators application for post-processing. Here, the software based quality metrics SHALL be determined and be displayed to the operator. The operator SHALL decide to accept or reject the facial image. After post-processing, the final facial image is released into the further application process (refer to [Application Profile Biometric Data Selection](#page-21-0)).

Note, the facial images captured SHALL be handled, transported and loaded into the operator's application by the agency's operators (officials) only. Applicants or service providers MUST NOT gain access to the facial images at any time during this process.

Also note that this Application Profile does not apply to facial image acquisition by photo service providers in a studio set-up using digital cameras (refer to [Application Profile Facial Image Digital Delivery via Cloud](#page-16-0) [\(BSI TR-03170\)](#page-16-0)) nor to facial image acquisition setting using a digital camera directly attached to the operators application (refer to [Application Profile Supervised Basic Facial Image Acquisition System\)](#page-12-0).

Within this application profile the facial image(s) for enrolment of a German Identity Document are acqui red by a facial image service provider (e.g. photographer), who then uploads the acquired image(s) to fa cial images cloud provider. This implies that the image acquisition is conducted detached from the agency. The facial image(s) are delivered to the agency from a facial images cloud provider according to [\[BIB\\_TR-03170\]](#page-89-0).

Facial images that are delivered within this Application Profile SHALL comply with the following require ments:

- **â¢** High-quality facial images: The facial image SHALL comply with the quality requirements defined within this Technical Guideline. In particular facial images taken by the enrolee him- or herself (selfie) SHALL NOT be used.
- **â¢** Use of wide-angle shots: The requiqrements for focal length (depending on the size of the camera sensor) as described within this Technical Guideline SHALL be complied with. The facial image SHALL NOT be captured using a wide-angle setting.
- **â¢** Live capture by natural person: The facial image that is delivered was captured live by a natural person who ensures that the requirements for facial images (especially facial image quality and the exclusion of presentation attacks) are met.
- **â¢** Use of surveillance equipment: The usage equipment is not sufficient to ensure the requi rements above especially regarding facial image quality and the exclusion of presentation attacks.
- **â¢** Personal responsibility and registration of capturing person: For details see [\[BIB\\_TR-03170\]](#page-89-0).

The facial images cloud provider SHALL ensure that the facial images that will be delivered to the agency fulfil the requirements defined in this application profile. Lossy compressions or upscaling SHALL NOT be performed on the facial images within the facial images cloud.

There are no Partial Application Processes to be applied for this Application Profile.

# <span id="page-17-1"></span><span id="page-17-0"></span>**3.6. Application Profile Facial Image Delivery by Scan of Photograph**

This Application Profile is only applicable in a few special cases which are defined by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and within German represenations abroad (Foreign Office) only. Apart from these specific cases, scanning of photographs MUST NOT be used after 30th April 2025.

Within this application profile the facial image(s) for enrolment of a German Identity Document are ac quired by scanning of a photograph which the applicant hands over to the operator. Note that the photograph of the applicant MAY be a grey scale image.

The photograph SHALL be compliant with the requirements for biometric images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9). The ope rator manually verifies whether the photograph depicts the applicant. After the operator visually inspected the photograph with the help of a photo guideline, and, if needed, with the help of a photo template (refer to [FM QA-FI-PG](#page-58-1) and [FM QA-FI-PT\)](#page-59-0), the photograph SHALL be scanned (refer to [PAP ACQ-FI-SV-1: Su](#page-33-0) [pervised Facial Image Acquisition by Scan of Photograph\)](#page-33-0). Afterwards, the scanned facial image SHALL be processed by the quality assurance module (software, refert to [FM Category Quality Assessment\)](#page-55-0).

[Figure 3.6](#page-18-0) depicts the facial image acquisition process by scanning the photograph of the applicant.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**3.9. Application Profile Biometric Data Selection**

This Application Profile specifies the selection of acquired biometric data by an operator for a German Identity Document.

### **3.9.1. Mandatory Process**

The following subsection specifies the overall process of selection already acquired biometric data, fin gerprint and facial images, for a German Identity Document. For all German Identity Documents, a facial image (for every applicant) as well as two fingerprints (only for applicants from the age of six years and older) of the applicant have to be captured electronically[2](#page-21-2) . This is done in accordance with [FM Category Acquisiti](#page-47-4) [on Hardware](#page-47-4), [FM Category Acquisition Software](#page-51-2) and [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-54-3).

The resulting facial image SHALL not be compressed. For facial images a software-based quality assessment SHALL be conducted. For live images and cloud images, the facial image of the size 1244x1600 pixels SHALL be used for quality assessment. For scanned images, the facial image of the size 622x800 pixels SHALL be used for quality assessment.

<span id="page-21-2"></span><sup>2</sup> Furthermore a signature is captured, but this is not part of the description within this document.

The resulting biometric data of the fingerprints can be reduced in size by lossy compression. However, multi ple lossy compressions SHALL NOT take place. If not already compressed, the compression of the fingerprint images SHALL be performed after the quality assessment process.

The facial image and the fingerprint images as well as additional quality information, which is connected to the biometric data, SHALL be coded and then passed to the calling application.

#### **3.9.1.1. Overview Process**

[Figure 3.9](#page-22-0) depicts the biometric overview process of selection already acquired data, fin gerprint and facial images, for German Identity Documents purposes. A copy of the facial image SHALL be processed for usage in the Register of Documents.

After selection of all necessary biometric data, all data is coded into the respective transmission format and stored within the final log that is sent to the central document production.

The process depicted is for illustration purpose only. Note, that the following section will detail this process for fingerprint and facial image selection.

<span id="page-22-0"></span>If biometric data were acquired in an unsupervised manner (e.g. at a [SSS\), all data \(facial images and finger](#page-86-2) prints if applicable) are to be retrieved from this device together in one call.

![](_page_22_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 3.9.** Overview Process of Application Profile Biometric Data Selection

#### <span id="page-22-1"></span>**3.9.1.2. Fingerprint Selection Procedure**

The fingerprint image acquisition and the detailed selection procedures applicable to this Application Profile are described in [Application Profile Supervised Fingerprint Acquisition.](#page-20-0) Note, the requirements from [Ap](#page-20-0) [plication Profile Supervised Fingerprint Acquisition apply to this Application Profile as well. For further in](#page-20-0) formation regarding applicable Partial Application Processes and Function Modules, see [Section 3.8.](#page-20-0)

Fingerprint images that were acquired beforehand by an unsupervised acquisition process, e.g. at a [SSS](#page-86-2), SHALL be verified at the counter according to [FM Category Biometric Comparison](#page-72-2). This control verification ensu res that the legitimated applicant's fingerprints have been captured at the previous unsupervised system. The control verification required in this Application Profile is described in [Application Profile Supervised Fin](#page-20-0) [gerprint Acquisition](#page-20-0). During control verification, all fingerprints from unsupervised sources SHALL be veri fied against the fingerprints that are captured supervised. Note, for acquisitions of fingerprint verifi

cation purposes, no quality thresholds apply. In case the verification fails, the fingerprint enrolment SHALL be repeated at the counter.

[Figure 3.10](#page-23-0) depicts the overall control verification process at the counter.

<span id="page-23-0"></span>![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 3.10.** Overview Process of Control Verification of Fingerprints

#### **3.9.1.3. Facial Image Selection Procedure**

[Figure 3.11](#page-24-0) depicts the general biometric process of the facial image selection procedure, which is performed by an operator.

- 1. The facial images of the applicant from different possible sources SHALL be made available. The possible sources are:
	- **â¢** Facial images taken at a [SSS](#page-86-2) (see [Section 3.1](#page-10-5))
	- **â¢** Facial images taken at the clerks desk by an automated system (Facial Image Acquisition System, see [Section 3.2](#page-11-0))
	- **â¢** Facial images taken at the clerks desk with an attached digital camera (Basic Facial Image Acquisition System, see [Section 3.3](#page-12-0))
	- **â¢** Facial images taken with a detached digital camera (see [Section 3.4\)](#page-14-0)
	- **â¢** Facial images delivered to the agency via cloud (see [Section 3.5](#page-16-0))
	- **â¢** Facial images scanned at the clerks desk (see [Section 3.6](#page-17-1), only for special cases)
- 2. The quality of the images SHALL be assessed.
- 3. All images with sufficient quality SHALL be presented to the operator, they MAY be sorted according to different characteristics, such as: quality, age of image, etc. If images with sufficient quality are present, an additional option to make images with insufficient quality viewable SHOULD be available. If no images with sufficient quality are present, all images with insufficient quality SHALL be presented to the operator.
- 4. In case a PAD alarm was raised, the operator SHALL evaluate whether the PAD alarm was legitimate. A PAD alarm is legitimate if e.g. the applicant tried to deceive the system or tested the limits of the system. If the operator decides that the PAD alarm was legitimate, the entire document enrolment process SHALL be aborted.
- 5. The applicant SHALL be visually verified by the operator. Especially in cases of live captured or delivered facial images, the operator SHALL check that the acquired facial image shows the applicant.
- 6. The images SHALL be inspected visually by the operator. In addition to the check by [Quality Assessment](#page-86-4) [\(QA\)](#page-86-4) software, the operator MAY verify geometric features of images using a digital photo templa te (one for adults and one for children, refer to [Section 5.4.4\)](#page-59-0) as well as a photo guideline (refer to [Sec](#page-58-1) [tion 5.4.3\)](#page-58-1).

The operator SHALL have the option to give a veto in order to overrule the [QA](#page-86-4) software decisions. If the operator gives a veto (veto equals "no") a positive software decision of the quality assessment SHALL be overruled and the facial images SHALL be rejected. In case, the operator rejects all facial images with a positive software decision, all other facial images with insufficient quality SHALL be presented. Thus, the operator SHALL have the option to accept images despite a negative software [QA](#page-86-4) decision (veto equals "yes").

7. If at least one image is left, the operator SHALL choose and release one image. Otherwise no image SHALL be released.

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**3.10. Application Profile Processing for Document Production**

The biometric data selected beforehand by the operator are processed by the central Document Production to produce the document(s) for applicant in question. This application profile is not available for certification purposes. [Figure 3.12](#page-26-0) depicts the overview process of the document production.

<span id="page-26-0"></span>![](_page_26_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 3.12.** Overview Process of Application Profile Processing for Document Production

The application data is received from the agency and processed to produce the requested document(s) of the applicant. Note, that the process described above only focusses on biometric data. Additional application data is not subject to this technical guideline. [Figure 3.12 depicts the processing of facial image and fin](#page-26-0) gerprints (if present) for the document production process.

At first the facial image SHALL be received by central Document Production from the agency in charge (refer to [FM COD-FI-PRD\)](#page-82-1). From this facial image several copies SHALL be generated. Each image SHALL satisfy the respective [QA](#page-86-4) standards ( [FM QA-FI-GENERIC](#page-56-0) and [FM QA-FI-GID](#page-58-0) for facial images and [FM QA-FP-](#page-60-0)[APP](#page-60-0) for finger prints). The original received facial image MAY be deleted afterwards at any time. Every copy of the facial image SHALL be compressed according to its purpose:

- **â¢** One copy of the facial image SHALL be processed for usage in the chip personalisation.
- **â¢** Another copy of the facial image SHALL be processed for usage for printing on the document.

Note, that more copies of the original facial image are produced which not subject to this Technical Gui deline (e.g. facial images for laser engraving etc.).

Compression of an already compressed image SHALL NOT be done. (E.g.: An already compressed image for usage in the Register of Documents SHALL NOT be compressed for usage in chip personalisation.)

Second, (if present) the fingerprint images SHALL be received by central Document Production from agen cy in charge and SHALL be processed for usage in the chip personalisation.

Parallel to production preparations, an overall evaluation of the biometric data SHALL be applied. The results of the respective [QA](#page-86-4) standards application ( [FM QA-FI-GENERIC](#page-56-0) and [FM QA-FI-GID](#page-58-0) for facial images and

[FM QA-FP-APP](#page-60-0) for finger prints) SHALL be included in the evaluation (further details see [FM Category](#page-85-1) [Evaluation](#page-85-1)).

**Table 3.17** Required Function Modules for Application Profile Processing for Document Production

# **3.10.2. Mandatory Partial Application Processes**

There are no Partial Application Processes to be applied for this Application Profile.

# <span id="page-28-0"></span>**4. Partial Application Processes**

The [Partial Application Processes \(PAPs\)](#page-86-5) specified by the following sections provide process specifications of basic biometric processes, e.g. the acquisition, identification or verification of biometrics or the evaluation processes for verification and identification. The [PAPs](#page-86-5) are referenced by the relevant Application Profiles and are part of the overall processes specified therein.

A [PAP](#page-86-5) MAY also be a task. A task is a process which functions as a generic reusable building block which is used by another [PAP](#page-86-5) and is not referenced by an Application Profile directly.

The specific Function Modules that SHALL be implemented in the processes of this chapter are specified by the relevant Application Profiles.

# <span id="page-28-2"></span><span id="page-28-1"></span>**4.1. PAP ACQ-FI-AUTO-1: Automated Facial Image Acquisition**

The facial image acquisition process described by this section applies to acquisition processes where the facial image is acquired automatically, refer to [Figure 4.1](#page-29-0). Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FI-1: Capture Live Facial](#page-29-1) [Image](#page-29-1) is used here.

An acquisition system SHALL be used that works with an integrated quality assessment Function Module (see [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-55-0)). The requirements of [FM Category Acquisition Hardware,](#page-47-4) [FM Category](#page-51-2) [Acquisition Software](#page-51-2) and [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-54-3) SHALL apply. The process SHALL use the following steps:

- 1. The biometric subject SHALL be guided to present its face.
- 2. The camera system SHALL be automatically configured for the body height of the person.
- 3. Multiple faces in the acquisition image area SHALL be detected. Note, the detection SHALL be carried out all the time while the acquisition is ongoing until the facial image is captured.
- 4. If multiple faces are detected, a guidance SHALL advice the biometric subject to appear alone in front of the acquisition system.
- 5. The distance of the biometric subject to the camera system SHALL be determined.
- 6. If the biometric subject is not in the optimal capture range, a guidance SHALL advice the biometric subject to enter the optimal distance range.
- 7. If a facial image can not be captured within a configured timeout, e.g. the biometric subject does not look in the camera or disappears from the system, the acquisition processes ends. The timeout SHALL be configurable.
- 8. The facial image of the biometric subject SHALL be captured. The image SHALL then be cropped and derotated to the face.
- 9. The quality of the facial image SHALL be assessed according to the specific Function Module in [FM](#page-55-0) [Category Quality Assessment.](#page-55-0)
- 10. If the quality is not sufficient and the timeout is not exceeded, a new facial image is captured. The timer for the timeout SHALL start with the retrieval of the first facial image from the capture system.
- 11. If the quality is sufficient, the facial image is released for the calling application.
- 12. If the timeout is exceeded and no image is of sufficient quality, the best facial image is selected among the captured images according to the specific Function Module in [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-55-0) and the image SHALL be released for the calling application.
- 13. With optimal conditions (bona fide) the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed the following time limits:
	- a. For devices that are subject to TR volume Border Control (BCL), the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed ten seconds. In case the system is not required to perform a [PAD](#page-86-3) (e.g. supervised scenario) the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed seven seconds.
	- b. For devices that are subject to TR volume German Identity Documents (GID), the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed thirty seconds (including [PAD\)](#page-86-3).

# <span id="page-30-0"></span>**4.2. PAP ACQ-FI-SV-4: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition**

## **4.2.1. Process**

The facial image acquisition process, refer to [Figure 4.3](#page-31-1), described by this section requires a supervised si tuation. Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FI-1: Capture Live Facial Image](#page-29-1) is used here. The biometric subject's facial image is captured using live enrolment equipment (including a digital camera within a photo studio setup) operated by an operator[2](#page-30-2) .

In case the acquisition system detects a face, the facial image capture SHALL be performed automatically. However, the operator SHALL also have option to perform capture manually. An immediately per formed cropping and de-rotation of the face and software quality assessment for the captured facial image ensures its biometric usability. If the quality assessment succeeds positively, the image SHALL be shown to the operator. If the quality is assessed as insufficient and the timeout has not exceeded yet, the system SHALL recapture. If the operator has captured manually, the image SHALL be shown to the operator in any case. In case the timeout has exceeded, the system SHALL identify the best captured facial image and show this image to the operator. The operator SHALL have the option to correct the cropping and de-rotation on the shown image manually. The operator SHALL also have the option to accept the captured facial image. The image is then release to the calling application. This is also the case, if the quality has been assessed as insufficient by the system. In the negative case, the facial image SHALL be discarded, the timeout is reset and a recapture is performed.

If the timeout exceeds and no facial image has been captured (neither with sufficient nor with insufficient quality), the process terminates without releasing an image. It is operator's decision to restart acquisi tion process or to perform other actions.

The process SHALL be supervised by an operator.

**Figure 4.4.** Partial Application Process Task "Capture Live Facial Image"

# <span id="page-31-0"></span>**4.3. PAP ACQ-FI-SV-5: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition System**

This Partial Application Process specifies a facial image acquisition system to automatically acquire or manu ally capture facial images for enrolment, verification or identification purposes. Note, that the [PAP ACQ-FI-](#page-28-2)[AUTO-1: Automated Facial Image Acquisition](#page-28-2) is used here.

### **4.3.1. Process**

The facial image acquisition system consists of two main processes, whereby the automatied acquisition is mandatory in all application scenarios while the manual mode is

**â¢** OPTIONAL for devices that are subject to TR volume German Identity Documents (GID)

<span id="page-31-3"></span><sup>3</sup> Note that the requirement for PAD in supervised settings might be subject to transitional arrangements. The final obligation is regulated through the selection of mandatory Function Modules within the respective Application Profiles.

**â¢** MANDATORY for other devices, especially in the context of TR volume Border Control (BCL).

The overall process is depicted in [Figure 4.5:](#page-32-0)

- 1. The operator triggers the automatic acquisition of a facial image for enrolment or verification/iden tification. The operator reviews the acquired facial image and the results of the software based [QA](#page-86-4). The operator SHALL have the option to manually crop and de-rotate the image. In case the manual review revealed bad quality of the facial image, the operator MAY discard the facial image in order to acquire a new facial image. The operator releases the image for further processing.
- 2. The operator triggers the manual acquisition of a facial image for enrolment or verification/identifi cation. The operator manually configures the camera system to the body height of the biometric subject (or triggers automatic height configuration). Next, the operator triggers the capture of a facial image of the biometric subject. The operator reviews the results of the software based [QA.](#page-86-4) The operator SHALL have the option to manually crop and de-rotate the image. In case the manual review revealed bad quality of the facial image, the operator MAY discard the facial image in order to acquire a new facial image. The operator releases the image for further processing.

To support the two processes, the system provides the following two service modes via its interface, refer to [Section 4.3.1.1:](#page-32-1)

1. *automated mode*

In this mode, the system obtains a request from the calling application to acquire an image by a certain quality level (enrolment, verification/identification quality). The system executes the required process au tonomously and returns the final image to calling application. Thereby, system handles pro cess execution, e.g. configuration of the camera system to the height of the biometric subject, mandatory repetitions due to quality issues, [QA](#page-86-4), automatic capture of the facial image etc. The system SHALL imple ment the processes specified by the [PAP ACQ-FI-AUTO-1: Automated Facial Image Acquisition](#page-28-2) for the automated mode. This service mode is MANDATORY in all application scenrios.

2. *manual mode*

In this mode, the system acts as a capture device for the calling application. The calling application sends atomic requests to the system, e.g. to adjust the system to the height of the biometric subject, to switch on the lighting or to capture a facial image. This service mode is OPTIONAL in the application context German Identity Documents (GID).

# <span id="page-33-0"></span>**4.4. PAP ACQ-FI-SV-1: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition by Scan of Photograph**

This Partial Application Process is only applicable in a few special cases which are defined by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior. Apart from these specific cases, scanning of photographs MUST NOT be used.

The facial image acquisition process described by this section applies to supervised situations whe re the facial image is acquired by an operator scanning a printed image, refer to [Figure 4.7](#page-33-2).

A photo taken and printed by a photographer is provided by the biometric subject. At first, a visual check SHALL be performed by the operator, refer to [Section 5.7](#page-67-3) and [Section 5.4.](#page-55-0) The operator SHALL manually verify whether the photo depicts the biometric subject. Depending on the result of the visual inspection, the photo is rejected or accepted for further processing. In the successful case, the image SHALL be digitised with a scanner by the operator, refer to [Section 5.1](#page-47-4), [Section 5.2](#page-51-2) and [Section 5.3,](#page-54-3) and be compressed, refer to [Section 5.6.](#page-66-3) Afterwards, the scanned image SHALL be subject to quality assessment, refer to [Section 5.4](#page-55-0). Finally, the operator SHALL have the option, to give a veto in order to overrule the [QA](#page-86-4) software decision.

<span id="page-33-2"></span>![](_page_33_Figure_9.jpeg)

<span id="page-33-3"></span><sup>4</sup> Note that the requirement for PAD in supervised settings might be subject to transitional arrangements. The final obligation is regulated through the selection of mandatory Function Modules within the respective Application Profiles.

In addition to the check by [QA](#page-86-4) software, the operator MAY verify the geometric features of the image using a photo template (one for adults and one for children), refer to [Section 5.4](#page-55-0). If the operator gives a veto (veto

equals yes) a negative software decision of the quality assessment SHALL be overruled and the facial image SHALL be released. The operator SHALL in addition have the option to reject an image despite a positive software [QA](#page-86-4) decision.

The process SHALL be supervised by an operator.

# <span id="page-34-2"></span><span id="page-34-0"></span>**4.5. PAP DEL-FI-SV-1: Supervised Facial Image Digital Delivery**

## **4.5.1. Process**

The facial image delivery process, refer to [Figure 4.8](#page-34-1), described by this section requires a supervised situation performed by an operator [5](#page-34-3) .

After loading the captured facial image(s) into the operators application, an immediately performed cropping and de-rotation of the face software quality assessment for captured facial image(s) ensures its bio metric usability. Following a quality assessment the image(s) SHALL be shown to the operator. The system MAY identify the best captured facial image, show this image to the operator and preselect it. The operator SHALL have the option to correct the cropping and de-rotation on the shown image(s) manually. The operator SHALL also have the option to accept one of the captured facial image(s). The image is then released to the calling application. This is also the case, if the quality has been assessed as insufficient by the system.

In the case that the operator rejects the image(s) the process terminates without releasing an image. This is also the case, if the quality has been assessed as sufficient by the system.

Note, the facial image(s) captured SHALL be handled, transported and loaded into the operators application by the operators only. The biometric subject MUST NOT gain access to the facial image(s) at any time during this process.

# <span id="page-36-1"></span>**4.6.2. PAP Task ACQ-FPS-SV-1: Capture Slap Supervised**

[Figure 4.11](#page-38-0) depicts the basic process for a plain supervised slap capture. A plain slap capture can be part of more complex acquisition processes, e.g. a ten finger acquisition by the 4-1-4-1 capture sequence. The plain slap capture is subsequently described in detail. The quality assessment conducted according to the requi rements of the applicable [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-55-0). Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FPP-SV-2: Cap](#page-38-1) [ture Plain Fingerprint Supervised](#page-38-1) is used here.

If the biometric subject is physically not capable to place all fingers of the slap on the capture hardware at the same time to achieve a slap image of good quality, the operator can decide to capture each finger of the slap in single finger capture mode. This SHALL be possible during the entire process. Hereby, single finger capture mode refers to the [PAP Task ACQ-FPP-SV-2: Capture Plain Fingerprint Supervised](#page-38-1) as described below.

- 1. The counter variable for the number of attempts for capturing the current slap SHALL be initialized as *i* = 1.
- 2. The slap image SHALL be retrieved from hardware. While the image is retrieved from hardware, [PAD](#page-86-3) SHALL be performed. Note: The operator have the option to manually conduct capture of sla p(s).
- 3. The fingerprints SHALL be segmented and each fingerprint SHALL be quality assessed.
	- a. In case the quality of the fingerprints meets the quality requirements defined in the corresponding [QA](#page-86-4) Function Module, the captured slap and the set of segmented fingerprints and parameter data (e.g. quality values) SHALL be temporarily stored.
	- b. In case the quality requirements for one or more fingerprints of the slap are not met, the capture SHALL be repeated up to two times (i.e. the acquisition of a single slap consists of a maximum of three capture attempts). The counter SHALL be set to *i* = *i* + 1.
- 4. A uniqueness check SHALL be conducted for the captured slap image to detect capture of wrong fin gers, e.g. due to interchanged hands or multiple acquisition of the same hand finger. Note, that it is RE COMMENDED to conduct the uniqueness check as early as possible after a fingerprint image is available.
	- a. In case
		- **â¢** the comparison of any fingerprint of the current slap with any previously accepted fingerprint of a previous slap or
		- **â¢** the comparison of any fingerprint of the current slap with another fingerprint of the current slap

is successful, the uniqueness check SHALL raise a warning.

- b. In case the comparisons of all fingerprints of the current slap with all fingerprints of previous slaps are not successful, the uniqueness check SHALL NOT show a warning.
- 5. Generally, a slap classifier SHALL be used for the captured slap image to detect the capture of the wrong slap. It SHALL be configurable to switch the classifier off or in evaluation mode (logging of result wi thout showing the result/warning to the operator). Note, that the slap classifier is only required for 4 finger slaps. Other acquisitions currently do not require the corresponding FM.
	- a. If the result of the classification concludes that the acquired slap mismatches the expected slap, a warning SHALL be reported.
	- b. If the result of the classification concludes that the acquired slap matches the expected slap, no warning SHALL be reported.

If the quality check of the third capture attempt fails (counter *i* is set to 3), the best of the captured slaps SHALL be identified according to the corresponding [QA](#page-86-4) Function Module and temporarily stored along with the corresponding information.

The process SHALL be supervised by an operator.

At the end of the process the operator decides on one of the three options:

- 1. Use the acquired slap.
- 2. Recapture the current slap. The counter SHALL be reset to *i* = 1.
- 3. Restart the total slap acquisition workflow.

The operator SHALL have the following veto options:

- **â¢** Select none of the captured slaps despite sufficient quality.
- **â¢** Select a slap of insufficient quality from the acquisition process.

At any point of the process the operator MAY decide to acquire any finger of the slap individually.

[CTF](#page-86-8) values computed from equations [Equation 5.1](#page-50-0) and [Equation 5.2 for nominal test frequencies are given in the fol](#page-50-1) lowing table. None of the [CTF](#page-86-8) modulation values measured at specification spatial frequencies SHALL exceed 1.05. The output bar target image SHALL NOT exhibit any significant amount of aliasing. It is NOT REQUIRED that the bar target contains the exact frequencies listed in [Table 5.1,](#page-50-2) however, the target does need to cover the listed frequency range and contain bar patterns close to each of the listed frequencies.

The following equations are used to obtain the minimum acceptable [CTF](#page-86-8) modulation values when using bar targets that contain frequencies not listed in [Table 5.1](#page-50-2):

#### **5.4.1.1.1. General Requirements**

The [QA](#page-86-4) module is used for the software-based automatic check of the conformance of the picture to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9) after the digitisation. Thereby, the geometric properties of the picture as well as the digital parameters of the image are analysed and rated.

The standard which is relevant for the quality of facial images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\] hierarchically describes requi](#page-88-9) rements for the facial images. In the following, full frontal images are expected.

The [QA](#page-86-4) module SHALL analyse and evaluate all of the quality criteria listed in [Table 5.2](#page-56-1). For the criteria marked with "M", the quality values SHALL be provided while quality values for the criteria marked with "O" MAY be provided in the defined format according to the respective criteria.

A criterion is fulfilled if its calculated value is in the given threshold boundaries.

Based on the results of all provided quality criteria the [QA](#page-86-4) module SHALL reject or approve the picture. The total result is true if every single quality criteria is fulfilled.

The [QA](#page-86-4) module SHALL provide an interface for conformance testing where a single image can be processed and the calculated values and configuration data are returned. The image type to process depends on the image type requirements of the application profile to implement.

The [QA](#page-86-4) module SHOULD operate on cropped images retrieved from the image processing according to [FM](#page-54-3) [Category Biometric Image Processing.](#page-54-3)

**Table 5.2** Mapping of Relevant Quality Criteria

#### **5.4.1.1.2. Identification of the Best Capture**

When multiple facial images and their corresponding set of quality metrics are present, the best capture of the list SHALL be identified in an automated manner as described in the following[1](#page-57-0) :

1. If exactly one facial image conforms to more mandatory criteria than all other images, this image is chosen.

<span id="page-57-0"></span><sup>1</sup> Note that this is a description of the automated selection of the best capture among a list of facial images. Operators may always decide otherwise during the process (veto).

- 2. If more than one facial image is conform to more mandatory criteria than all other facial images, the facial image fulfilling the most optional criteria SHALL be chosen.
- 3. If more than one facial image is conform to more mandatory and optional criteria than all other facial images, the most recent facial image within this selection SHALL be chosen. If no timestamp is available, a random selection MAY be applied among the facial images fulfilling the most criteria.

**Table 5.3** Quality Threshold Requirements for Facial Images for Enrolment Scenarios for Identity Documents

# <span id="page-58-1"></span>**5.4.3. FM QA-FI-PG**

This Function Module describes requirements for a photo guideline that is used for Quality Assessment.

#### **5.4.3.1. Recommendations**

If the [QA](#page-86-4) is to be performed by a person, visual tools like a photo guideline MAY be used for support.

If the visual check is conducted with the photo guideline, it always SHALL be done even if the checks with the photo template and/or the [QA](#page-86-4) software will be performed afterwards. A recent picture is required according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9) .

If these basic criteria are not met, the image SHALL be rejected without any further checks by the software or the photo template.

In the case of the photo guideline, the following criteria SHALL be described, preferably using sample images for compliant and non compliant images (compare [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9) ):

- **â¢** frontal pose
- **â¢** neutral expression
- **â¢** mouth closed
- **â¢** eyes open
- **â¢** no occlusion (glasses, hair, eye patch)
- **â¢** eyes looking to the camera
- **â¢** background uniformity (plainness, no textures, colour)
- **â¢** no shadows
- **â¢** no head coverings
- **â¢** no further people / objects
- **â¢** equally distributed lighting
- **â¢** no shadows over the face
- **â¢** no shadows in the eye sockets
- **â¢** no hot spots on skin
- **â¢** no effects from glasses
- **â¢** correct exposure
- **â¢** correct contrast
- **â¢** focus and depth of field
- **â¢** no unnatural colours
- **â¢** no red eyes

# <span id="page-59-0"></span>**5.4.4. FM QA-FI-PT**

This Function Module describes requirements for a photo template that is used for [QA.](#page-86-4)

#### **5.4.4.1. Requirements**

The photo template SHALL be used to determine if the geometric requirements of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\] are ful](#page-88-9) filled (e.g. format, the height of the face and the centred alignment of the face). For this purpose, the photo template SHALL be placed digitally on the image and SHALL be checked by the operator.

For the photo template at least the following criteria out of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-88-9) SHALL be supported.

- **â¢** image height
- **â¢** image width
- **â¢** head height
- **â¢** eye positions
- **â¢** centred horizontally

For images of children under the age of 10, different requirements for the height of the head and the area of the eyes MAY be used. That is why a special photo template for children SHALL exist to check the acceptability of the image.

For the images of infants and babies younger than 6 years, additional tolerances concerning the pose of the head, the facial expression and the line of sight MAY be allowed, compared to those already described by the photo template for children.

### <span id="page-60-0"></span>**5.4.5. FM QA-FP-APP**

This Function Module describes requirements for the quality assessment of plain or rolled fingerprints inclu ding quality assessment of single fingerprint, respectively slap and selection of the best quality image out of multiple instances.

#### **5.4.5.1. Requirements**

#### **5.4.5.1.1. Quality Algorithm**

As quality algorithm, the latest version of [NIST Fingerprint Image Quality 2.2 \(NFIQ2.2\)](#page-86-13) [\[BIB\\_NFIQ2.2\]](#page-88-12) SHALL be used, and therefore, images with 1000 ppi SHALL be resampled to 500 ppi before application of [NFIQ2.2](#page-86-13). Note, that the resampled image SHALL be used for [NFIQ2.2](#page-86-13) only. As resulting quality value, the output value of [NFIQ2.2](#page-86-13) in the integer range of [0,100] SHALL be used. In the case of failure, the returned error code 255 indicates that a computation was not successful and the resulting quality value SHALL be returned as the result, as described in [Section 5.11.1](#page-73-1).

#### **5.4.5.1.2. Quality Evaluation Process for a Slap or Single Fingerprint**

In case a single captured fingerprint, respectively slap is passed, the [QA](#page-86-4) SHALL be performed as described in the following. Beforehand, the fingerprints of the passed capture SHALL be segmented (considering missing fingers). Note, that in verification applications, a [QA](#page-86-4) is not conducted. Thus, every slap capture is considered sufficient and no thresholds are specified here. Skipping the [QA](#page-86-4) is expected to accelerate the overall process. OPTIONALLY, a [QA](#page-86-4) can be performed.

- 1. For each segmented fingerprint *FA;j* of a passed capture *A*, a quality value *QA;j* is calculated with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 (up to 4 fingers in one slap) representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FIN](#page-88-8) [GER\].](#page-88-8)
- 2. The resulting quality value is compared with the defined threshold *T Hj* for this finger. The application specific thresholds as defined in the following section apply.
- 3. In case all of the fingerprint qualities reach the specified threshold (i.e. *8j; QA;j Â¸ T Hj* ), the boolean infor mation *b* = 1 indicates a successful capture.
- 4. In case one or more fingerprints do not reach the threshold (i.e. *9j; QA;j < T Hj* ), the boolean information *b* = 0 indicates insufficient quality of the capture.
- 5. For the segmented fingerprint *FA;j* the corresponding parameter set *PA;j* is compiled and returned.
- 6. As a result of the [QA](#page-86-4) process, the following values are returned to the calling process:
	- a. the boolean information *b*
	- b. the parameter set *PA* = *QA;j ; :::; QA;l* with *j; l 2* 1*; :::;* 10 representing the specific finger code

#### **5.4.5.1.3. Identification of the Best Capture out of Multiple Captures**

When multiple captures *Ai ;i 2* 1*; :::; n* and their corresponding set of segmented fingerprints *FAi ;j* with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-88-8) are passed, the best of the captures SHALL be identified as described in the following section:

- 1. For each segmented fingerprint *FAi ;j* of a passed capture *Ai* , the quality value *QAi ;j* is calculated with re presenting the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-88-8).
- 2. The captures are ranked according to the quality values of the fingerprints according to the following (lexicographical) order. The highest ranked capture is considered as the capture yielding the best quality.
	- a. for left/right four-finger slaps, the order is as follows:
- i. index finger (highest priority)
- ii. middle finger
- iii. ring finger
- iv. little finger (lowest priority)

Example 1: Two Slaps of a right hand. Middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the first slap have a better quality than the middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the second slap, but the quality of the index finger is better in the second slap. Consequently, the second slap SHALL be taken.

Example 2: Three Slaps of a left hand. The quality of the index finger and the middle finger is the same in all three slaps, but the quality of the ring finger is better in the first slap. So the first slap SHALL be taken, no matter how high or low the quality of the little finger is in any slap.

- b. for thumb slaps, the order is as follows:
	- i. right thumb (highest priority)
	- ii. left thumb (lowest priority)
- c. for index finger slaps:
	- i. In contrast to the other two slap types, the best capture of index finger slaps is a set of the best captures of each index finger as indicated by the following two options.

If each index finger yields sufficient quality in at least one of the already conducted captures, the index fingers of sufficient quality are accepted and the total index finger slap capture is considered as of sufficient quality.

If not both index fingers yield at least once sufficient quality in a capture, the best image for each index finger is returned as the best capture and the slap captured is considered as of insufficient quality.

- ii. If for a single slap both index fingers yield to sufficient quality, those two index fingers SHALL be selected even if an index finger of another slap yield to better quality.
- d. for rolled single finger captures:
	- i. Of the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand, which are not annotated by a hardware reported issue, the capture with the highest quality value is considered as the best image.
	- ii. If the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand on does only contain images which are annotated by hardware reported issues, the capture with the highest quality value of the entire set is considered as the best image.
	- iii. In case several captures yield to the same highest quality value, the last (temporal) of highest quality captures is considered as the best image.
- 3. As a result of the [QA](#page-86-4) process, the following values are returned:
	- a. the identifier *i* representing the capture yielding the best quality
	- b. the parameter set *PA* = *QAi;j ; QAi;l* with *j; l 2* 1*; :::*10.

#### **5.4.5.1.4. Thresholds for Plain Fingerprints for Enrolment Purposes**

The following thresholds as indicated in [Table 5.4](#page-62-0) apply when fingerprints are captured plain for enrolment purposes. Note, the thresholds in [Table 5.4](#page-62-0) do not apply to plain captured fingerprint in enrolment scenarios where the plain fingerprints are captured for control purpose of rolled fingerprints. In that case, thresholds as indicated in [Table 5.5](#page-62-1) apply for the plain fingerprints.

# <span id="page-63-0"></span>**5.5. FM Category Presentation Attack Detection**

The objective of the Function Module [Presentation Attack Detection](#page-86-3) is to avoid presentations with the goal to subvert an enrolment, verification of identification process.

# <span id="page-63-1"></span>**5.5.1. FM PAD-FI-APP1**

This Function Module describes requirements for [PAD](#page-86-3) in the context of the acquisition of facial images. This Function Module is especially relevant for use cases where no direct observation of the acquisition process by an operator is possible (e.g. in self-service scenarios).

### **5.5.1.1. Requirements**

#### **5.5.1.1.1. General Requirements**

The capture subsystem SHALL contain a [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem detecting spoofing attempts using artefacts by which an attacker is trying to establish a different biometric characteristic as probe in the verification or identifica tion process.

The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem MAY consist of hardware and software (e.g. the used camera system MAY have additional sensors designed for this purpose).

The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL be able to detect different artefact classes listed in the following:

- **â¢** Complete artefacts (covering the whole or nearly the whole face of the attacker), either built from one piece or from multiple pieces.
- **â¢** Partial artefacts (covering only parts of the attacker's face, such as artefacts covering the chin only), either built from one piece or from multiple pieces.

The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL be able to detect all well-known artefact material types listed in the following:

- **â¢** Photographs printed on paper with different thicknesses and structures of paper and different structures of printing (colouring, etc.).
- **â¢** Photographs displayed on electronic devices (e.g. phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) where different methods of displaying might be used.
- **â¢** Videos displayed on electronic devices, especially showing motion of the biometric subject.
- **â¢** Photographs printed on fabrics with different thicknesses and structures of the me thods of printing (flock print, silk screening, etc.).
- **â¢** 3D masks in big (size of a face) and small (smaller than a normal face) sizes and different thicknesses based on,
- **â¢** Paper
- **â¢** Casted silicon
- **â¢** 3D-printer
- **â¢** Latex

On top of the listed attack classes and materials, additional MAY be detected by PAD sub system:

- **â¢** Makeup (normal or professional)
- **â¢** Additional artefacts beyond the imitation of faces, such as glasses etc.

Under optimal testing conditions, the [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL feature a false-alarm-rate of 2% maximum when tested with bona fide biometric subjects. This rate is monitored via logfiles analysis within the operational environment. If this rate is significantly exceeded, any certification that may have been issued might be reevaluated (depending on application context)[2](#page-64-0) .

Also, the detection subsystem SHALL be adequate to the usage setting in correspondence with the security requirements in question. The performance MAY be described by a risk analysis for every considered attack type. The current version of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_PAD\\_3\]](#page-88-13) SHALL be taken into account.

#### **5.5.1.1.2. Integration Requirements**

The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL be independent of the regular capture subsystem, i.e. it NOT inhibit captu ring image data in case of a suspected attack. It SHALL signal its detection results in the form of a [PAD](#page-86-3) score to the calling application. The score SHALL be a normalized double in the range [0,1] using at least ten uniformly distributed interim values, where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack. A binary score SHALL NOT be used (e.g. True or False, 1 or 0). Detailed information about the [PAD](#page-86-3) (results) SHALL be logged as described in [Section 5.12](#page-81-0). The technical information including the result value and description of the mapping between technical result and interpretation SHALL be stored additionally, if they are provided.

Even if the Function Module is used within a comparison scenario, the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case, independent from any biometric comparison score. Also, the omission of the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case.

The [PAD](#page-86-3) result SHALL correspond to the chosen facial image.

#### **5.5.1.1.3. Maintenance Requirements**

As new technologies and new attack mechanisms are developed over time, the [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL be regularly updated and reevaluated.

#### **5.5.1.1.4. Certification Requirements**

To ensure comparable performance of presentation attack detection subsystems, the system SHALL be certi fied

- **â¢** either under the Common Criteria Agreement according to the Protection Profile "BSI-CC-PP-0118-2022: Common Criteria Protection Profile - Biometric Mechanisms Protection Profile (BMPP), Version 2.0, base PP and at least the functional package PAD"
- **â¢** or according to BSI TR-03122: Conformance Test Specification for Technical Guideline TR-03121 Bio metrics for Public Sector Applications, respectively this technical guideline.

#### **5.5.1.1.5. Transition Rules**

The requirements of this module do not apply until May 2025.

<span id="page-64-0"></span><sup>2</sup> Note that during certification a relaxed false-alarm-rate is tested. The requirement of the rate specified in this Function Module is tested on operational collected data only.

### <span id="page-65-0"></span>**5.5.2. FM PAD-FP-APP**

This Function Module describes requirements for [PAD](#page-86-3) in the context of acquisition biometric charac teristics of fingerprints.

The capture system SHALL contain a [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_PAD\\_1\] detecting spoofing at](#page-88-14) tempts using artefacts by which an attacker is trying to establish a different biometric characteristic as probe in the verification or identification process.

The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem MAY consist of hardware and software (e.g. the used fingerprint scanner have addi tional sensors designed for this purpose).

According to the used fingerprint scanner, [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL be able to detect artefact classes listed in the following:

- **â¢** Fingertips, created in different thicknesses
- **â¢** Single fingers (massive)

Under optimal testing conditions, the [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL feature a false-alarm-rate of 2% maximum when tested with bona fide biometric subjects with generally good quality fingerprints. This rate is monitored via logfiles analysis within the operational environment. If this rate is significantly exceeded, any certification that may have been issued might be re-evaluated (depending on application context) [3](#page-65-1) .

Also, the detection subsystem SHALL be adequate to the usage setting in correspondence with the security requirements in question. The performance MAY be described by a risk analysis for every considered attack type. The current version of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_PAD\\_3\]](#page-88-13) SHALL be taken into account.

The [PAD SHALL be conducted both in supervised acquisition scenarios, e.g. a counter scenario, and un](#page-86-3) supervised acquisition scenarios, e.g. in [SSS](#page-86-2) scenarios. Thereby, the [PAD](#page-86-3) SHALL be conducted for all acquisi tion purposes, e.g. enrolment, identification and verification.

The score for each finger SHALL be a normalized as double in the range [0,1] using at least ten uniformly distributed interim values, where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack. A binary score SHALL NOT be used (e.g. True or False, 1 or 0). The [PAD](#page-86-3) subsystem SHALL additionally provide detailed information about the scores of the [PAD.](#page-86-3)

<span id="page-65-1"></span><sup>3</sup> Note that during certification a relaxed false-alarm-rate is tested. The requirement of the rate specified in this Function Module is tested on operational collected data only.

The overall result SHALL be a boolean value (e.g. True or False). The value SHALL be true, if any of the fingers individual result triggers a [PAD](#page-86-3) alarm.

Even if the Function Module is used within a comparison scenario, the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case, independent from any biometric comparison score. Also, the omission of the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case.

The [PAD](#page-86-3) result SHALL correspond to the respective finger capture attempt.

Note, that an image of the fingerprint or slap in question SHALL be acquired independently of a possible PAD alarm.

#### **5.5.2.1.3. Maintenance Requirements**

This section contains information abount the evaluation of quality scores within German document pro duction and is therefore applicable to the German passport production only.

#### <span id="page-85-2"></span>**5.13.1. FM EVA-ALL-APP**

This Function Module defines general requirements for evaluations within the German document produc tion.

#### **5.13.1.1. Requirements**

According to Â§5 [\[BIB\\_PassDEÃV\]](#page-88-16) and Â§9 [\[BIB\\_PAuswV\]](#page-88-17), the German document manufacturer creates quality statistics which contains anonymized quality values for facial images and fingerprints.

These quality statistics are to be created by the document manufacturer on the basis of these [TR.](#page-86-12) The template for this will be specified in an appendix **to be created in a future version** of this [TR.](#page-86-12)
