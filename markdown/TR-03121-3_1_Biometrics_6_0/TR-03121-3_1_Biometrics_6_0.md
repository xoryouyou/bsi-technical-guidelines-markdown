# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**1. Volume Border Control**

BSI TR-03121, Volume 1 [Border Control \(BCL\)](#page-89-1), covers the biometric processes of border control. Thereby, en rolment of the biometric subject's characteristics as well identification and verification bio metric subjects' identities with the help of biometric characteristics are subprocesses of the general border control processes. Biometric characteristics used in border control processes are [facial images \(FIs\)](#page-89-2) and plain [fingerprints \(FPs\).](#page-89-3)

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2. Application Profiles**

The following sections specify the Application Profiles of this Volume. processes specified by Appli cation Profiles of this Volume support a number of border control configurations.

# <span id="page-7-3"></span><span id="page-7-1"></span>**2.1. Application Profile Manual Border Control**

This Application Profile specifies the requirements for [Manual Border Control \(MBC\)](#page-89-4) systems equipped with a facial image acquisition system and a fingerprint acquisition system.

## **2.1.1. Mandatory Process**

The following subsections specify the overall process of the biometric operations of the [MBC and the bio](#page-89-4) metric border control checks required per border control use case at the [MBC.](#page-89-4)

## **2.1.1.1. Overview Process**

[Figure 2.1](#page-7-2) depicts the general biometric process of the [MBC](#page-89-4). The ad hoc process depicted is for illustration purpose only.

At the [MBC](#page-89-4) the border guard assesses alphanumeric and biometric candidate lists. In case true matches are identified, the border guard takes the necessary actions such as guiding the traveller to the second line or linking existing records. The border guard acquires missing biometric modalities or assesses the biometric modalities acquired unsupervised at a downstream system. In addition, the border guard assesses biometric verification results.

[Figure 2.3](#page-10-2) depicts the acquisition process at semi-mobile manual border control. Semi-mobile equip ment is meant to be portable (e.g. placed within in a suit-case), but is not hand-held.

In general, the biometric data of the biometric subject SHALL be captured sequentially. Depending on the use case it is required to acquire fingerprints and / or a facial image of the biometric subject. For all acquisitions enrolment quality SHALL be used in order to simplify the over all processes (e.g. a facial image that has been used for a verification is not needed to be recaptured for an enrolment).

In the end the acquired biometrics are used for enrolment, verifications and / or identifications within one or multiple [Central Indentity Registers \(CIRs\).](#page-89-5)

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>**2.6. Application Profile Self-Service System**

This Application Profile specifies the requirements for [self-service systems \(SSSs\)](#page-90-1) equipped with a facial image acquisition system, a fingerprint acquisition system and a document reader.

## **2.6.1. Mandatory Process**

The following subsections specify the overall process of the biometric operations of the [SSS](#page-90-1) and the biometric border control checks required per border control use case at the [SSS.](#page-90-1)

## **2.6.1.1. Overview Process**

[Figure 2.5](#page-14-0) depicts the general biometric process of the [SSS.](#page-90-1)

A live facial image of the biometric subject is acquired. In some use cases acquisition finger prints is started in parallel. In case an applicable biometric modality could not be acquired from the biometric subject, the following process steps requiring this modality are skipped and the next border control step is the [MBC.](#page-89-4)

Afterwards, the verification of the live facial image is carried out against the reference facial image on the [Electronic Machine Readable Travel Document \(eMRTD\)](#page-89-9) and the evaluation workflow is started. In some use cases fingerprint verifications against [CIRs](#page-89-5) (e.g. [CS EES](#page-89-8) or [Visa Information System \(VIS\)](#page-90-2)) are performed in parallel. If the verification against a [CIR](#page-89-5) failed, an identification is performed within the same system which SHALL be multimodal if possible. The retrieval of the identification results SHALL never block the release message to the biometric subject to proceed to the next border control system.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>**2.7. Application Profile Biometric Matching Systems**

This Application Profile specifies requirements for a [Biometric Matching System \(BMS\)](#page-89-10).

## **2.7.1. Mandatory Process**

The following subsections specify the overall process of the [BMS](#page-89-10) as well as different evaluation workflows.

#### **Figure 2.6.** Overall BMS Process

## **2.7.1.2. Evaluation Worflows**

The outcome of a biometric verification (match vs. non-match) [1](#page-16-0) or identification (candidate list) is only relia ble if the corresponding error rates are quantified and monitored. In order to enable a competent authority to evaluate false and true match rates and to configure the [BMS](#page-89-10) comparison thresholds, the Application Profile specifies evaluation workflows which SHALL be executed in parallel for requests received by the [BMS](#page-89-10) or made available to the [BMS,](#page-89-10) unless the main working processes would be impaired in times of high load.

Note, the specifications of evaluation workflows do not distinguish between the type of biometric modality and are generic. Thus, they SHALL be applied to measure biometric performance of fingerprint, facial image and multimodal verification and identification depending on the used biometric modalities of the relevant system.

The evaluation workflows enable a competent authority...

- **â¢** ... to continuously monitor biometric accuracy in terms of security and usability of the system.
- **â¢** ... to precisely reconfigure comparison thresholds in order to meet defined security or usability targets.
- **â¢** ... to assess the biometric performance of new comparison algorithms or updates of deployed comparison algorithms prior to deployment.
- **â¢** ... to determine thresholds for deploying new or updated algorithms in order to meet defined security and usability targets.
- **â¢** ... to evaluate and compare new quality algorithms or updates of deployed quality algorithms.
- **â¢** ... to determine quality thresholds for biometric modalities to be included or excluded in a [BMS](#page-89-10) to meet the defined accuracy targets.
- **â¢** ... to evaluate and compare comparison algorithms to attribute type specific performance differences, e.g. sex or age.

The process specified by [PAP EVA-ID-wCIR-1: Identification Evaluation Workflow for BMS with Identifi](#page-32-1) [cation Capability and with Verification Capability](#page-32-1) SHALL be executed if an identification request is received.

The process specified by [PAP EVA-VER-wCIR-1: Verification Evaluation Workflow for BMS with Identifi](#page-38-0) [cation Capability and with Verification Capability](#page-38-0) SHALL be executed if a verification request is received and the [BMS](#page-89-10) does not offer an identification capability.

The process specified by [PAP EVA-VER-nCIR-1: Verification Evaluation Workflow for BMS without Iden](#page-44-0) [tification Capability](#page-44-0) SHALL be executed if a verification request is received and the [BMS](#page-89-10) does offer an iden tification capability.

## **2.7.2. Mandatory Function Modules**

All Function Modules which SHALL be applied for this Application Profile are listed in [Table 2.11](#page-16-1). All listed Function Modules (separated by commas) are mandatory for this Application Profile unless specified other wise. Function Modules separated by slash are alternatives to each other.

<span id="page-16-0"></span><sup>1</sup> The term "biometric match" is ambiguous and could literally mean both "biometric recognition/comparison" or "biometric conformity/hit/ equivalence". In the European Regulations and Implementing Acts, it appears being used for both meanings. For the sake of clarity, "match" will only correspond to a hit in the biometric recognition in the following, unless used within the fixed term "biometric matching system", where it is used in the sense of "recognition".

**Table 2.12** Required Partial Application Processes Application Profile Automated Border Control

# <span id="page-18-0"></span>**3. Partial Application Processes**

The [Partial Application Processes \(PAPs\)](#page-90-3) specified by the following sections provide process specifications of basic biometric processes, e.g. the acquisition, identification or verification of biometrics or the evaluation processes for verification and identification. The [PAPs](#page-90-3) are referenced by the relevant Application Profiles and are part of the overall processes specified therein.

A [PAP](#page-90-3) MAY also be a task. A task is a process which functions as a generic reusable building block which is used by another [PAP](#page-90-3) and is not referenced by an Application Profile directly.

The specific Function Modules that SHALL be implemented in the processes of this chapter are specified by the relevant Application Profiles.

# <span id="page-18-2"></span><span id="page-18-1"></span>**3.1. PAP ACQ-FI-SV-5: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition System**

This Partial Application Process specifies a facial image acquisition system to automatically acquire or manu ally capture facial images for enrolment, verification or identification purposes. Note, that the [PAP ACQ-FI-](#page-24-0)[AUTO-1: Automated Facial Image Acquisition](#page-24-0) is used here.

## **3.1.1. Process**

The facial image acquisition system consists of two main processes, whereby the automatied acquisition is mandatory in all application scenarios while the manual mode is

- **â¢** OPTIONAL for devices that are subject to TR volume German Identity Documents (GID)
- **â¢** MANDATORY for other devices, especially in the context of TR volume Border Control (BCL).

The overall process is depicted in [Figure 3.1:](#page-19-0)

- 1. The operator triggers the automatic acquisition of a facial image for enrolment or verification/iden tification. The operator reviews the acquired facial image and the results of the software based [Quality](#page-90-4) [Assessment \(QA\).](#page-90-4) The operator SHALL have the option to manually crop and de-rotate the image. In case the manual review revealed bad quality of the facial image, the operator MAY discard the facial image in order to acquire a new facial image. The operator releases the image for further processing.
- 2. The operator triggers the manual acquisition of a facial image for enrolment or verification/identifi cation. The operator manually configures the camera system to the body height of the biometric subject (or triggers automatic height configuration). Next, the operator triggers the capture of a facial image of the biometric subject. The operator reviews the results of the software based [QA.](#page-90-4) The operator SHALL have the option to manually crop and de-rotate the image. In case the manual review revealed bad quality of the facial image, the operator MAY discard the facial image in order to acquire a new facial image. The operator releases the image for further processing.

To support the two processes, the system provides the following two service modes via its interface, refer to [Section 3.1.1.1:](#page-19-1)

1. *automated mode*

In this mode, the system obtains a request from the calling application to acquire an image by a certain quality level (enrolment, verification/identification quality). The system executes the required process au tonomously and returns the final image to calling application. Thereby, system handles pro cess execution, e.g. configuration of the camera system to the height of the biometric subject, mandatory repetitions due to quality issues, [QA](#page-90-4), automatic capture of the facial image etc. The system SHALL imple

ment the processes specified by the [PAP ACQ-FI-AUTO-1: Automated Facial Image Acquisition](#page-24-0) for the automated mode. This service mode is MANDATORY in all application scenrios.

2. *manual mode*

In this mode, the system acts as a capture device for the calling application. The calling application sends atomic requests to the system, e.g. to adjust the system to the height of the biometric subject, to switch on the lighting or to capture a facial image. This service mode is OPTIONAL in the application context German Identity Documents (GID).

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>**3.2. PAP ACQ-FI-SV-4: Supervised Facial Image Acquisition**

## **3.2.1. Process**

The facial image acquisition process, refer to [Figure 3.3](#page-21-1), described by this section requires a supervised si tuation. Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FI-1: Capture Live Facial Image](#page-19-3) is used here. The biometric subject's facial image is captured using live enrolment equipment (including a digital camera within a photo studio setup) operated by an operator[2](#page-20-2) .

In case the acquisition system detects a face, the facial image capture SHALL be performed automatically. However, the operator SHALL also have option to perform capture manually. An immediately per formed cropping and de-rotation of the face and software quality assessment for the captured facial image ensures its biometric usability. If the quality assessment succeeds positively, the image SHALL be shown to the operator. If the quality is assessed as insufficient and the timeout has not exceeded yet, the system SHALL recapture. If the operator has captured manually, the image SHALL be shown to the operator in any case. In case the timeout has exceeded, the system SHALL identify the best captured facial image and show this image to the operator. The operator SHALL have the option to correct the cropping and de-rotation on the shown image manually. The operator SHALL also have the option to accept the captured facial image. The image is then release to the calling application. This is also the case, if the quality has been assessed as insufficient by the system. In the negative case, the facial image SHALL be discarded, the timeout is reset and a recapture is performed.

If the timeout exceeds and no facial image has been captured (neither with sufficient nor with insufficient quality), the process terminates without releasing an image. It is operator's decision to restart acquisi tion process or to perform other actions.

The process SHALL be supervised by an operator.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**3.3. PAP ACQ-FI-USV-1: Unsupervised Facial Image Acquisition with Prequalification**

The facial image acquisition process described by this section applies to unsupervised acquisition situations. The full process of image acquisition and the prequalification of the live facial image is presented in [Figu](#page-22-0) [re 3.5](#page-22-0). Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FI-1: Capture Live Facial Image](#page-19-3) is used here.

The following steps SHALL be performed. Live image data is captured with respect to [FM Category Acqui](#page-56-3) [sition Hardware](#page-56-3), [FM Category Acquisition Software,](#page-62-3) [FM Category Biometric Image Processing](#page-64-0) and [FM](#page-65-0) [Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0). Prequalification (as defined by [FM QA-FI-PRE\)](#page-68-1) ensures that only images of sufficient quality are taken. Live image data MAY be compressed according to [FM Category Compression](#page-75-0).

If the image quality is not sufficient and the specified timeout is not reached and no [PAD](#page-89-7) alarm is triggered, the following SHALL be done: The captured image SHALL be added to a sorted list (sorted by image quality) and a new image SHALL be captured.

This process will finish in one of the following conditions:

- **â¢** If the image quality is sufficient and the specified timeout is not reached and no [PAD](#page-89-7) alarm is triggered, the acquired image SHALL be returned.
- **â¢** If the timeout is reached and the sorted image list is not empty, the best quality image from the image list SHALL be returned. Otherwise if the list is empty no image SHALL be returned.
- **â¢** If a [PAD](#page-89-7) alarm is triggered, the [PAD](#page-89-7) alarm message and the acquired image SHALL be returned to the calling application and displayed to the operator.

The timeout SHALL be configurable.

All gathered information is logged and coded according to [FM Category Coding](#page-86-0) and [FM Category Logging](#page-83-2).

During the complete transaction of acquisition an operator SHOULD ensure that the biometric subject does not try to illegally bypass the system by using presentation attack instruments or other mechanisms. By me ans of [FM Category Presentation Attack Detection](#page-71-0) the operator SHALL receive a warning when the PAD subsystem detects a spoofing attack.

The process SHALL use the following steps:

- 1. The biometric subject SHALL be guided to present its face.
- 2. The camera system SHALL be automatically configured for the body height of the person.
- 3. Multiple faces in the acquisition image area SHALL be detected. Note, the detection SHALL be carried out all the time while the acquisition is ongoing until the facial image is captured.
- 4. If multiple faces are detected, a guidance SHALL advice the biometric subject to appear alone in front of the acquisition system.
- 5. The distance of the biometric subject to the camera system SHALL be determined.
- 6. If the biometric subject is not in the optimal capture range, a guidance SHALL advice the biometric subject to enter the optimal distance range.
- 7. If a facial image can not be captured within a configured timeout, e.g. the biometric subject does not look in the camera or disappears from the system, the acquisition processes ends. The timeout SHALL be configurable.
- 8. The facial image of the biometric subject SHALL be captured. The image SHALL then be cropped and derotated to the face.
- 9. The quality of the facial image SHALL be assessed according to the specific Function Module in [FM](#page-65-0) [Category Quality Assessment.](#page-65-0)
- 10. If the quality is not sufficient and the timeout is not exceeded, a new facial image is captured. The timer for the timeout SHALL start with the retrieval of the first facial image from the capture system.
- 11. If the quality is sufficient, the facial image is released for the calling application.
- 12. If the timeout is exceeded and no image is of sufficient quality, the best facial image is selected among the captured images according to the specific Function Module in [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0) and the image SHALL be released for the calling application.
- 13. With optimal conditions (bona fide) the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed the following time limits:
	- a. For devices that are subject to TR volume Border Control (BCL), the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed ten seconds. In case the system is not required to perform a [PAD](#page-89-7) (e.g. supervised scenario) the overall facial image acquisition process SHALL NOT exceed seven seconds.

[Figure 3.11](#page-28-0) depicts the basic process for a plain supervised slap capture. A plain slap capture can be part of more complex acquisition processes, e.g. a ten finger acquisition by the 4-1-4-1 capture sequence. The plain slap capture is subsequently described in detail. The quality assessment conducted according to the requi rements of the applicable [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0). Note, that the [PAP Task ACQ-FPP-SV-2: Cap](#page-28-1) [ture Plain Fingerprint Supervised](#page-28-1) is used here.

If the biometric subject is physically not capable to place all fingers of the slap on the capture hardware at the same time to achieve a slap image of good quality, the operator can decide to capture each finger of the slap in single finger capture mode. This SHALL be possible during the entire process. Hereby, single finger capture mode refers to the [PAP Task ACQ-FPP-SV-2: Capture Plain Fingerprint Supervised](#page-28-1) as described below.

- 1. The counter variable for the number of attempts for capturing the current slap SHALL be initialized as *i* = 1.
- 2. The slap image SHALL be retrieved from hardware. While the image is retrieved from hardware, [PAD](#page-89-7) SHALL be performed. Note: The operator have the option to manually conduct capture of sla p(s).
- 3. The fingerprints SHALL be segmented and each fingerprint SHALL be quality assessed.
	- a. In case the quality of the fingerprints meets the quality requirements defined in the corresponding [QA](#page-90-4) Function Module, the captured slap and the set of segmented fingerprints and parameter data (e.g. quality values) SHALL be temporarily stored.
	- b. In case the quality requirements for one or more fingerprints of the slap are not met, the capture SHALL be repeated up to two times (i.e. the acquisition of a single slap consists of a maximum of three capture attempts). The counter SHALL be set to *i* = *i* + 1.
- 4. A uniqueness check SHALL be conducted for the captured slap image to detect capture of wrong fin gers, e.g. due to interchanged hands or multiple acquisition of the same hand finger. Note, that it is RE COMMENDED to conduct the uniqueness check as early as possible after a fingerprint image is available.
	- a. In case
		- **â¢** the comparison of any fingerprint of the current slap with any previously accepted fingerprint of a previous slap or
		- **â¢** the comparison of any fingerprint of the current slap with another fingerprint of the current slap
		- is successful, the uniqueness check SHALL raise a warning.
	- b. In case the comparisons of all fingerprints of the current slap with all fingerprints of previous slaps are not successful, the uniqueness check SHALL NOT show a warning.
- 5. Generally, a slap classifier SHALL be used for the captured slap image to detect the capture of the wrong slap. It SHALL be configurable to switch the classifier off or in evaluation mode (logging of result wi thout showing the result/warning to the operator). Note, that the slap classifier is only required for 4 finger slaps. Other acquisitions currently do not require the corresponding FM.
	- a. If the result of the classification concludes that the acquired slap mismatches the expected slap, a warning SHALL be reported.
	- b. If the result of the classification concludes that the acquired slap matches the expected slap, no warning SHALL be reported.

If the quality check of the third capture attempt fails (counter *i* is set to 3), the best of the captured slaps SHALL be identified according to the corresponding [QA](#page-90-4) Function Module and temporarily stored along with the corresponding information.

The process SHALL be supervised by an operator.

At the end of the process the operator decides on one of the three options:

- 1. Use the acquired slap.
- 2. Recapture the current slap. The counter SHALL be reset to *i* = 1.
- 3. Restart the total slap acquisition workflow.

The operator SHALL have the following veto options:

- **â¢** Select none of the captured slaps despite sufficient quality.
- **â¢** Select a slap of insufficient quality from the acquisition process.

This Partial Application Process specifies how the evaluation of biometric identification SHALL be carried out for biometric matching systems with identification and verification capability.

Our notation and exposition in this section closely follows the ISO-standard.

## **3.10.1. Identification Results and Identification Errors**

The goal of *(algorithmic) identification* is to identify a subject by means of a given *(biometric) sample* (for in stance, a facial image) inside a register that contains *(biometric) reference templates* of a set of individuals. In a typical algorithmic setting, the outcome of an identification process is based on the computation of numerical scores that are meant to quantify the resemblance between the given sample and the reference (templates) from the register. The algorithm then outputs a *candidate list* that contains all those subjects from the register for which the corresponding numerical score exceeds a pre-defined threshold. In particular, the algorithm can return an empty list (no matching subject was found in the register), or a list which only contains a single subject.

An identification is also known as a (1:*n* comparison), since a single probe sample is compared to a set of *n* references, as opposed to the *verification setting* where we compare a single probe sample with a single reference sample. Accordingly, verification is also referred to as 1:1 comparison.

We now discuss the expected outcome of an identification process. First of all, if a subject *P* is enrolled in the register, then we expect that the identification system returns a candidate list *CL* which contains the subject *P*. We denote this expected *true-positive identification result* by *P 2 CL*. If, on the other hand, the identification system returns a candidate list that lacks the subject *P*, although *P* is enrolled in the register, then this is considered to be an erroneous result, namely a *false-negative identification (FNI)* result.

Analogously, let us consider the case where the subject *P* is not enrolled in the register. Obviously, in this case *P* cannot be on the returned candidate list. In this case we would expect that the algorithm returns an empty candidate list, denote by *CL* = *;*. This is a *true-negative identification* result. If, on the other hand, the identification system returns a non-empty candidate list, then it wrongly claims that *P* is contained in the register. This erroneous event is referred to as a *false-positive identification (FPI)* result.

In order to analyse the quality of the identification system it is important to approximate the probabilities for these two types of erroneous results. Indeed, without any kind of knowledge about the range of these two probabilities, the results of the identification system are more or less meaningless. To this end, we introduce appropriate empirical rates to control the quality of the identification results. But before we do this, let us summarise our setting in the following table:

|                  | P enrolled    | P not enrolled |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Expected Result  | P<br>CL<br>2  | CL<br>=<br>;   |
| Erroneous Result | P<br>CL<br>62 | CL<br>6=<br>;  |

**Table 3.1** Identification Results

## **3.10.2. Introduction to the Error Rates**

An identification (1:*n* comparison) consists of *n* successive comparisons between the current probe template and *n* references templates, where *n* usually denotes all reference templates enrolled in the identity register. Each match is added to a candidate list. Under the assumption that the [BMS](#page-89-10) supports deduplication, i.e. at most one mated template is among the *n* reference templates, two different initial situations for each identification are possible:

- **â¢** The identity register contains one *mated* (or *related*) reference to the current probe. This event is denoted as *R* in the context of identifications.
- **â¢** The identity register contains only *non-mated* (or *unrelated*) references to the current probe. This event is denoted as *R*Â¹ in the context of identifications.

In identifications with registers containing one mated reference, i.e. in case of event *R*, the following outcomes are possible:

- **â¢** The mated reference is correctly returned in the candidate list. This event is denoted as *IR*.
- **â¢** The mated reference is not included in the returned candidate list. This event is denoted as Â¹*IR*. Since the mated reference was among the *n* references for identification, this is a *false-negative-identification* error (event *<sup>R</sup> ^* <sup>Â¹</sup>*IR*).

In identifications with registers containing only non-mated references, i.e. in case of event *R*Â¹, the following outcomes are possible:

**â¢** The candidate list is empty. This event is denoted as *I;* . Since the mated reference was not among the *n* references for identification, this is the correct outcome.

**â¢** The candidate list is not empty. This event is denoted as *I*Â¹*;* . Since the mated reference was not among the *<sup>n</sup>* references for identification, this is a *false-positive-identification* (event *R*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>I</sup>*Â¹*;* ).

#### **3.10.2.1. Calculation of the Error Rates for Identification**

In the following context of identification evaluation, *jRj* and *jR*Â¹*j* denote the counts of the events *R* and *R*Â¹, respectively; i.e. *jRj* is the number of identifications with a probe, where the identity register contains one mated reference, and *jR*Â¹*j* is the number of identifications, where the identity register does not contain a mated reference. The quantities *j*Â¹*IRj*, *j<sup>R</sup> ^* <sup>Â¹</sup>*IRj*, *j*Â¹*I*Â¹*; <sup>j</sup>* and *jR*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^* <sup>Â¹</sup>*I*Â¹*; j* are defined accordingly as counts of the corresponding events.

The following definitions of the error rates are in accordance to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_19795-1:2021\].](#page-91-1)

#### **3.10.2.1.1. False-Negative Identification-Rate**

<span id="page-34-2"></span>The false-negative identification-rate ([false-negative-identification-rate \(FNIR\)\)](#page-89-12) is defined as the fraction of identifications not returning the mated reference as candidate among conducted with re gisters including a mated reference:

$$FNIR \quad = \frac{|R \land \bar{I}\_R|}{|R|}. \tag{3.1}$$

This quantity can be measured under laboratory conditions, but the daily application may lack the certain information, whether the mated reference was contained among the *n* references for identification (i.e. whe ther the identification represents event *jRj* or event *jR*Â¹*j*) and whether the correct mated reference is returned in the candidate list (i.e. whether the identification result represent event *IR* or Â¹*IR*). Therefore, the calculation of the [FNIR](#page-89-12) SHOULD only use identifications, where the mated reference is assumed to be contained in the identity register and to be known, e.g. by comparison of associated identity information or by an operator decision as described in [Section 3.10.3.3.](#page-37-0) In this case, an estimate of the [FNIR can be calculated using the fol](#page-89-12) lowing approximation and by estimating the count *j*Â¹*IRj* by the number of cases, in which the assumed mated reference is not returned in the candidate list. [6](#page-34-0)

$$FNIR \quad \approx \frac{|\bar{I}\_R|}{N\_{\rm FNIR}},\tag{3.2}$$

where *N*FNIR is the number of identifications performed to determine the [FNIR](#page-89-12).

#### **3.10.2.1.2. False-Positive Identification-Rate**

The false-positive identifications-rate ([false-positive-identification-rate \(FPIR\)](#page-89-13)) is defined as the fraction of identifications returning a non-empty candidate list among the conducted which did not in clude a comparison with the mated reference:[7](#page-34-1)

$$FPIR \quad = \frac{|\bar{R} \land I\_{\bar{0}}|}{|\bar{R}|}. \tag{3.3}$$

This quantity can be measured under laboratory conditions, but the daily application may lack the certain information, whether the mated reference is contained among the *n* references for identification (i.e. whether the identification represents event *jRj* or event *jR*Â¹*j*). Therefore, the calculation of the [FPIR](#page-89-13) SHOULD use only identifications, where the mated reference is assumed to be not contained in the identity register. If the mated reference is assumed to be known, e.g. by comparison of associated identity information or by an operator

<span id="page-34-0"></span><sup>6</sup> Ideally, the addition of non-mated references in the register should have no influence on the occurrence of mated references in the candidate list.

Under the assumption that multiple references do not refer to same biometric subject in identity re gister and that the true mated reference is excluded in nearly all *N*FPIR identifications (*jR*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> <sup>Â¼</sup> <sup>N</sup>*FPIR), the [FPIR](#page-89-13) can be calculated as the fraction of identifications returning at least one candidate among the identifications with excluded mated reference:

$$FPIR \quad \approx \frac{|I\_{\bar{0}}|}{N\_{\text{FPIR}}},\tag{3.4}$$

<span id="page-35-3"></span>where *N*FPIR is the number of identifications performed to determine the [FPIR](#page-89-13).

## **3.10.3. Identification Evaluation Workflow for BMS**

The identification evaluation workflow can be triggered by both a verification request and an identification request and uses the biometric probe and, in case of a verification request, the reference from the request for evaluation. Depending on the biometric algorithm, the templates may be generated either explicitly prior to the comparison or implicitly during the comparison.

**Figure 3.17.** Overall Identification Workflow

This Partial Application Process allows to determine the error rates [\(FNIRs](#page-89-12) and [FPIRs\)](#page-89-13) of [BMS](#page-89-10) for identification purpose.

## **3.10.3.1. Overall Process**

The overall process is comprised of two workflows:

**â¢** Either a verification workflow, which compares the presented candidate (probe) and reference, or an iden tification workflow, which compares the presented candidate (probe) with all references from the identity register. After execution of the verification or identification workflow, respectively, the result is returned to the calling application. [9](#page-35-2)

<span id="page-35-1"></span><sup>8</sup> Ideally, the inclusion of a mated reference in the register should have no influence on the occurrence of non-mated references in the candidate list. If this property can be assumed for an identification algorithm, the mated reference does not need to be excluded from the register; instead it can be simply ignored in the candidate list.

<span id="page-35-2"></span><sup>9</sup> The confidence in the assumed identity of the reference presented for verification is typically quite high, in particular, in case of a positive outcome. Therefore, these references from verification requests can be used to set up the identity registers used for the evaluation process.

**â¢** The evaluation workflow which conducts identifications with the presented probe by algorithms de ployed and under evaluation.

[Figure 3.17](#page-35-0) shows a general overview over the complete process within the [BMS.](#page-89-10) Note, that the process "Evaluation workflow" is detailed in the following subsection. The probe data (and reference data in case of a verification request) are received or made available to the [BMS. Templates are generated and the compari](#page-89-10) son is performed and logged according to [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2) Identification and evaluation logging data SHALL be linked by means of the provided transaction identifiers. Note, that the evaluation workflow MAY be scheduled to reduce system load at peak times. Templates MAY be cached to execute the evaluation workflow while low load is on the system.

![](_page_36_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 3.18.** Evaluation Workflow for Identification

An overview of the evaluation workflow is given in [Figure 3.18](#page-36-0). The evaluation workflow executes an iden tification with the current probe from the current (verification or identification) request. The result of the identification is logged according to [FM Category Coding](#page-86-0) and [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2) The identification and evaluation SHALL be conducted for each modality available separately and for the multimodal identification if multiple modalities are supplied in the initial (verification or identification) request. The evaluation work flow SHALL be an automatic process without manual processing.

In detail, the following process SHALL be executed in the evaluation workflow for identification:

- 1. A probe (sample or template) with one or more biometric modalities is received.
- 2. If not already conducted in a previous step, e.g. in a verification evaluation workflow, [QA MAY be conduc](#page-90-4) ted according to [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0).
- 3. To enhance the quality of the calculation, measures SHOULD be taken to ensure that a mated reference is contained in the register for the following identifications; exemplary measures are listed in [Sec](#page-37-0) [tion 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0). The following steps are REQUIRED to calculate the [FNIR](#page-89-12):
	- a. The score for the comparison of the current probe against the (assumed) mated reference from the identity register (genuine comparison) is obtained for the current identification setup under evalua tion. If this score is already available, e.g. due to a previous comparison between both templates, this result MAY be reused if the algorithms coincided. In particular for the calculation of a [Detection Error](#page-89-14)

[Trade-Off \(DET\)](#page-89-14) curve, where the threshold profile is the only varying parameter, scores need to be obtained just once for each probe-reference-pair.

- b. If the resulting score is below the threshold value for the identification under evaluation, the amount of false-negative-identifications *j*Â¹*IRj* is counted up.
- c. The amount of identifications for [FNIR](#page-89-12) evaluation, *N*FNIR, is counted up.
- d. In addition to the evaluation of the identification workflow in the current setup, steps 3(a) to 3(c) SHOULD be performed using other comparison algorithms and/or other threshold profiles. Note that for each algorithm (or deviating threshold profile), separate counts are REQUIRED.
- e. The [FNIRs](#page-89-12) for each setup under evaluation can be calculated by the fraction of both counts according to [Equation 3.1](#page-34-2).
- 4. To enhance the quality of the calculation, measures SHOULD be taken to ensure that a mated reference is not contained in the register for the following identifications; exemplary measures are listed in [Sec](#page-37-0) [tion 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0). The following steps are REQUIRED to calculate the [FPIR:](#page-89-13)
	- a. An identification is run, comparing the current probe template against all (assumed) non-mated refe rence templates from the identity register (imposter comparisons). If a comparison score exceeds the current threshold profile, the candidate is set on the candidate list.
	- b. If at least one candidate is returned during an identification, the amount of false-positive-identificati ons, *jIR*<sup>Â¹</sup>*j*, is counted up.
	- c. At the end of each identification, the amount of identifications for [FPIR](#page-89-13) evaluation, *N*FPIR, is counted up.
	- d. In addition to the evaluation of the identification workflow in the current setup, steps 4(a) to 4(c) SHOULD be performed using other identification algorithms under evaluation or threshold pro files. It should be noted that...
		- **â¢** ... for each setup under evaluation (register, algorithm, threshold profile), separate counts are RE QUIRED.
		- **â¢** ... the [FPIRs](#page-89-13) depends on the number *n* of references in the identity register and thus, the calculation of the [FPIRs](#page-89-13) (for a given algorithm) SHOULD NOT combine identifications with considerably vary ing register sizes *n* (e.g. due to amendments to the register),
		- **â¢** ... for the calculation of a [DET](#page-89-14) curve, i.e. [FPIRs](#page-89-13) for varying threshold values, the identification needs to be performed just on (using a low threshold profile) and the resulting scores can be checked against all required threshold values (greater or equal than the used in identification operati on) without successive reproduction of the comparison scores.
	- e. The [FPIR](#page-89-13) for each setup under evaluation is calculated by the fraction of both corresponding counts according to [Equation 3.4.](#page-35-3)
- 5. The results SHALL be logged according to [FM Category Coding](#page-86-0) and [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2)

## <span id="page-37-0"></span>**3.10.3.3. Optional Measures to Enhance the Quality of the Evaluation**

For the assumptions made above to calculate the error rates, it is essential to ensure, that the correct mated reference template is (or is not) contained in the pool of reference templates. Following implementations MAY be used to achieve this goal:

**â¢** For the accuracy evaluation of identifications or verifications using only one biometric modality, a pre ceding verification based on another biometric modality could give insight about the true nature (ma ted or non-mated) of the relation between probe and reference. As false-non-matches (or respectively fal se-matches) for different biometric modalities are independent, this does not introduce a bias. This is only possible if more biometric modalities are transmitted for the probe and are available for the references than required for the evaluation. Additionally, it MUST be ensured that the accuracy provided by verification of another modality is sufficiently high to prevent from introducing errors.

**â¢** Further insight about the true nature (mated or non-mated) of the relation between probe and reference can be obtained by operator decisions from the main-workflow. Any non-match appearing during the border control process will require further inspection by an operator. The final decision entered by the operator can be used as additional information. If the operator ends this inspection by deciding on a true-non-match, the probe-reference pair SHOULD be excluded in evaluation workflows requiring mated pairs. Thus, the evaluation workflow itself will still be completely automatic, though its start SHALL be delayed until the main border control process is terminated, see [Figure 3.19.](#page-38-1)

# <span id="page-38-0"></span>**3.11. PAP EVA-VER-wCIR-1: Verification Evaluation Workflow for BMS with Identification Capability and with Verification Capability**

This Partial Application Process specifies how the evaluation of biometric verification SHALL be carried out for biometric matching systems with identification and verification capability.

## **3.11.1. Introduction to the Error Rates**

Biometric verifications and identifications are based on single algorithmic comparisons between a probe and a reference template, quantifying the resemblance between each pair of templates by a numerical score. The binary result of a comparison (match or non-match) depends on whether this numerical score exceeds a preset threshold value.

A verification consist of a single 1:1 comparison between one probe template and one reference template. Therefore, two scenarios are possible for the incoming probe and reference templates:

- **â¢** Probe and reference are *mated* (or *related*), i.e. belong to the biometric characteristic of the same biometric subject. In the following context of verifications, this event is denoted as *R*.
- **â¢** Probe and reference are *non-mated* (or *unrelated*), i.e. do not belong to the same biometric characteristic of the same biometric subject. In the following context of verifications, this event is denoted as *R*Â¹.

A verification-threshold-value is set, so that two results for the biometric comparison are possible:

- **â¢** If the score is above or equal to the threshold, the result of the comparison is a *match*. In the following context of verifications, this event is denoted as *M*.
- **â¢** If the score is below the threshold, the result of the comparison is a *non-match*. In the following context of verifications, this event is denoted as *M*Â¹ .

As a consequence, four different scenarios between income and outcome are possible in a verification:

- **â¢** Probe and reference are *mated* and the verification returns a *match*. This is a correct result (*true-match*) and denoted as *R ^ M*.
- **â¢** Probe and reference are *mated* and the verification returns a *non-match*. This is an error referred to as *fal se-non-match* and denoted as *<sup>R</sup> ^ <sup>M</sup>*<sup>Â¹</sup> .
- **â¢** Probe and reference are *non-mated* and the verification returns a *match*. This is an error referred to as *fal se-match* and denoted as *R*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>M</sup>*.
- **â¢** Probe and reference are *non-mated* and the verification returns a *non-match*. This is a correct result (*truenon-match*) and denoted as *R*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>M</sup>*<sup>Â¹</sup> .

A false-match is usually security related, as access might be granted to an imposter. Therefore, an acceptable false-match-rate (FMR) needs to be predefined depending on the application and a strict obedience SHALL be monitored. A false-non-match can be related to a denial of access for a genuine user. This error is usually not security related, though a low false-non-match-rate (FNMR) is important to ensure a high performance, usability and acceptance by the users of the application.

## **3.11.1.1. Calculation of the Error Rates for Verification**

In the following context of verification evaluation, *jRj* denotes the amount of comparisons between mated templates for a set of *N* independent comparisons. The quantities *jR*Â¹*j*, *jMj*, *jM*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>*, *j<sup>R</sup> ^ <sup>M</sup>j*, *<sup>j</sup><sup>R</sup> ^ <sup>M</sup>*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>*, *jR*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>M</sup>j*, *jR*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>M</sup>*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>* are defined accordingly as counts of the corresponding events. This implies *<sup>N</sup>* <sup>=</sup> *<sup>j</sup>R<sup>j</sup>* <sup>+</sup> *<sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup>* <sup>=</sup> *<sup>j</sup>M<sup>j</sup>* <sup>+</sup> *<sup>j</sup>M*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>*.

The following definitions of the error rates are in accordance to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_19795-1:2021\].](#page-91-1)

#### **3.11.1.1.1. False-Non-Match-Rate (FNMR)**

The FNMR is defined as the fraction of comparisons returning a non-match among the comparisons between mated images:

$$\text{FNMR} \quad = \frac{|R \land \bar{M}|}{|R|}. \tag{3.5}$$

<span id="page-39-0"></span>Under laboratory conditions, *R* is known, i.e. whether two images are mated, thus *j<sup>R</sup> ^ <sup>M</sup>*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>* can be measured and the FNMR exactly calculated. Though the evaluation within the daily application lacks information about whether or not two images are truly mated, thus *R* is unknown. Therefore, the FNMR needs to be approxi mated:

$$\begin{split} \text{FNMR} \quad &= \frac{|R \wedge \bar{M}|}{|R|} \\ &= \frac{|\bar{M}|}{N\_{\text{FNMR}}} \left( 1 + \frac{|\bar{R}|}{|R|} \right) - \frac{|\bar{R} \wedge \bar{M}|}{|R|} \\ &\approx \frac{|\bar{M}|}{N\_{\text{FNMR}}} \,, \end{split} \tag{3.6}$$

where *N*FNMR is the number of verifications performed to determine the [false-non-match-rate \(FNMR\)](#page-89-15).

Here, both quantities *jM*<sup>Â¹</sup> *<sup>j</sup>* and *N*FNMR can be measured. The approximation in [Equation 3.6](#page-39-0) holds if *<sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> Â¿ <sup>j</sup>R<sup>j</sup> ) <sup>j</sup>R<sup>j</sup> <sup>Â¼</sup> <sup>N</sup>*FNMR, thus the amount of true-non-matches is negligible to the amount of false-nonmatches. Therefore, the calculation of the [FNMR](#page-89-15) SHOULD only use verifications, where the reference and probe can be assumed to be mated, e.g. by comparison of associated identity information or by an operator decision as described in [Section 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0). [10](#page-40-0)

#### **3.11.1.1.2. False-Match-Rate (FMR)**

The FMR is defined as the fraction of comparisons returning a match among the comparisons between nonmated images:

$$\text{FMR}^{\quad} = \frac{|\bar{R} \land M|}{|\bar{R}|}. \tag{3.7}$$

<span id="page-40-1"></span>Under laboratory conditions, *R*Â¹ is known, i.e. whether two images are non-mated, thus *jR*<sup>Â¹</sup> *^ <sup>M</sup>j* can be mea sured and the FMR exactly calculated. Though the evaluation within the daily application lacks information about whether or not two images are truely mated, thus *R*Â¹ is unknown. Therefore, FMR needs to be approxi mated:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{FMR} \quad &= \frac{|\bar{R} \wedge M|}{|\bar{R}|} \\ &= \frac{|M|}{N\_{\text{FMR}}} \left( 1 + \frac{|R|}{|\bar{R}|} \right) - \frac{|R \wedge M|}{|\bar{R}|} \\ &\approx \frac{|M|}{N\_{\text{FMR}}} \,, \end{aligned} \tag{3.8}$$

where *N*FMR is the number of identifications performed to determine the [false-match-rate \(FMR\)](#page-89-16).

Here, both quantities *jMj* and *N*FMR can be measured. The approximation in [Equation 3.8](#page-40-1) holds if *<sup>j</sup>R<sup>j</sup> Â¿ <sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> ) <sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> <sup>Â¼</sup> <sup>N</sup>*FMR, thus the amount of true-matches is negligible to false-matches. The refore, the calculation of the [FMR](#page-89-16) SHOULD only use verifications, where the reference and probe are assumed to be non-mated.

## **3.11.2. Verification Evaluation Workflow for BMS with Connected Identity Register**

The verification evaluation workflow is triggered by a verification request and uses the biometric probe and reference from the request for evaluation. Depending on biometric algorithm, templates may be ge nerated either explicitly prior to the comparison or implicitly during the comparison.

**Figure 3.21.** Verification Evaluation Workflow with Connected Identity Register

## **3.11.2.1. Evaluation Workflow**

An overview over the evaluation workflow is given in [Figure 3.21](#page-42-0). The evaluation workflow itself SHALL be comprised of three main tasks:

- **â¢** recommended [QA](#page-90-4) of the current probe and reference image
- **â¢** comparison of the current probe with the current reference using an additional comparison algorithm, which was not used for the normal verification, or varying threshold profiles
- **â¢** control-verifications of the current probe with non-mated reference templates

In detail, the following process SHALL be executed in the evaluation workflow for verification:

- 1. A probe template and the mated reference template are received.
- 2. [QA](#page-90-4) for evaluation purposes MAY be conducted according to [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0).
- 3. To enhance the quality of the calculation, measures SHOULD be taken to exclude non-mated comparisons in the following genuine comparisons. Exemplary measures are listed in [Section 3.10.3.3.](#page-37-0) The following steps are REQUIRED to calculate the [FNMR](#page-89-15):
	- a. The current probe is compared against the current (assumed mated) reference (genuine comparison) to obtain a score. If this score is already available, e.g due previous comparison between both tem

plates, this result MAY be reused if the algorithms coincided. In particular, for calculation of a De tection-Error-Tradeoff curve, where the threshold profile is the only varying parameter, scores need to be obtained just once for each probe-template-pair.

- b. If the score is below the threshold profile under evaluation, the amount of non-matches (*M*Â¹ ) is counted up.
- c. The amount of total comparisons (*N*FNMR) is counted up.
- d. In addition to the setup of the standard verification workflow, other comparison algorithms and/or other threshold profiles SHALL be evaluated here. Note that for each algorithm (or deviating threshold profile), the non-matches SHALL be counted separately.
- e. The [FNMR](#page-89-15) based on the yet evaluated data can be calculated for each setup according to [Equation 3.6](#page-39-0).
- 4. To enhance the quality of the calculation, measures SHOULD be taken to exclude mated comparisons in the following impostor comparisons. Exemplary measures are listed in [Section 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0). The following steps are REQUIRED to calculate [FMR](#page-89-16) as follows:
	- a. Comparisons of the current probe with a sufficiently large amount of *n* templates in a pool of nonmated references from the identity register are conducted without respect to similiar attributes (zero effort). It SHALL be ensured that the pool neither contains mated reference to probe nor mul tiple references of the same biometric subject.
	- b. For each comparison, *N*FMR is increased by 1.
	- c. For each comparison score exceeding the current threshold profile under evaluation, the (false) match counter *jMj* is increased by 1. As all templates without restriction are used, these the "zero-ef fort"-counts.
	- d. The [FMRs](#page-89-16) for probe-reference-pairs coinciding in certain attributes SHALL be accessed by separated counts for matches and comparisons when one of the following attributes coincides:
		- i. Age groups
		- ii. Sex
		- iii. Nationality
		- iv. Document Issuer of Identity Document

Additional attributes MAY be evaluated.

- e. The [FMRs](#page-89-16) for the zero-effort and all attributes based on yet evaluated data can be calculated ac cording to [Equation 3.8](#page-40-1).
- 5. The results are logged according to [FM Category Coding](#page-86-0) and [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2)

where *N*FNMR is the number of verifications performed to determine the [FNMR](#page-89-15).

$$\begin{aligned} \text{FMR} \quad &= \frac{|\bar{R} \wedge M|}{|\bar{R}|} \\ &= \frac{|M|}{N\_{\text{FMR}}} \left( 1 + \frac{|R|}{|\bar{R}|} \right) - \frac{|R \wedge M|}{|\bar{R}|} \\ &\approx \frac{|M|}{N\_{\text{FMR}}} \,, \end{aligned} \tag{3.12}$$

where *N*FMR is the number of identifications performed to determine the [FMR.](#page-89-16)

Here, both quantities *jMj* and *N*FMR can be measured. The approximation in [Equation 3.8](#page-40-1) holds if *<sup>j</sup>R<sup>j</sup> Â¿ <sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> ) <sup>j</sup>R*Â¹*<sup>j</sup> <sup>Â¼</sup> <sup>N</sup>*FMR, thus the amount of true-matches is negligible to false-matches. The refore, the calculation of the [FMR](#page-89-16) SHOULD only use verifications, where the reference and probe are assumed to be non-mated.

## **3.12.2. Verification Evaluation Workflow for BMS without Connected Identity Register**

The overall verification process is comprised of two workflows:

- **â¢** the verification workflow which compares the presented candidate (probe) with a reference and returns the result to the calling application
- **â¢** the evaluation workflow which conducts comparisons with algorithms under evaluation, executes im poster control-verifications for accuracy evaluation and may evaluate the quality of biometric modalities by quality algorithms under evaluation

Templates are generated and the comparison is performed and logged according to [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2) Verification and evaluation logging data SHALL be linked by means of the provided transaction identifiers.

**Figure 3.24.** Verification Evaluation Workflow without Connected Identity Register

## **3.12.2.1. Evaluation Workflow**

An overview over the evaluation workflow is given in [Figure 3.24](#page-48-0). The evaluation workflow itself SHALL be comprised of three main tasks:

- **â¢** recommended [QA](#page-90-4) of the current probe and reference image
- **â¢** comparison of the current probe with the current reference using an additional comparison algorithm, which was not used for the normal verification, or varying threshold profiles
- **â¢** control-verifications of the current probe with non-mated reference templates

In detail, the following process SHALL be executed in the evaluation workflow for verification:

- 1. A probe template and the mated reference template are recieved.
- 2. [QA](#page-90-4) for evaluation purposes MAY be conducted according to [FM Category Quality Assessment](#page-65-0).
- 3. To enhance the quality of the calculation, measures SHOULD be taken to exclude non-mated comparisons in the evaluation. Exemplary measures are listed in [Section 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0). The following steps are REQUIRED to calculate the [FNMR:](#page-89-15)
	- a. The current probe is compared against the current (assumed mated) reference (genuine comparison) to obtain a score. If this score is already available, e.g due previous comparison between both tem plates, this result MAY be reused if the algorithms coincided. In particular for calculation of a De tection-Error-Tradeoff curve, where the threshold profile is the only varying parameter, scores need to be obtained just once for each probe-template-pair.
	- b. If the score is below the threshold profile under evaluation, the amount of non-matches (*M*Â¹ ) is counted up.
	- c. The amount of total comparisons (*N*FNMR) is counted up.
	- d. In addition to the setup of the standard verification workflow, other comparison algorithms and/or other threshold profiles SHALL be evaluated here. Note that for each algorithm (or deviating threshold profile), the non-matches SHALL be counted separately.
	- e. The [FNMR](#page-89-15) based on the yet evaluated data can be calculated for each setup according to [Equation 3.6](#page-39-0).
- 4. It is RECOMMENDED to take measures to exclude mated comparisons in the following evaluation steps (e.g. in analogy to [Section 3.10.3.3](#page-37-0)) as the current probe template from the verification process is assumed to be compared against non-mated reference templates (imposter comparisons) to calculate the [FMR](#page-89-16) as follows:
	- a. Comparisons of the current probe with a sufficiently large amount of *n* templates in a pool of cached non-mated references are conducted without respect to similiar attributes (zero effort). The pool SHALL NOT contain the mated reference to the probe or multiple references of the same biometric subject.
	- b. For each comparison, *N*FMR is increased by 1.
	- c. For each comparison score exceeding the current threshold profile under evaluation, the (false) match counter *jMj* is increased by 1. As all templates without restriction are used, these the "zero-ef fort"-counts.
	- d. The [FMRs](#page-89-16) for probe-reference-pairs coinciding in certain attributes MAY be accessed by separated counts for matches and comparisons when one of the following attributes coincides:
		- i. Age groups
		- ii. Sex
		- iii. Nationality
		- iv. Document Issuer of Identity Document

Additional attributes MAY be evaluated.

- e. The cache is updated:
	- **â¢** The reference mated to the current probe SHALL be added cache after imposter compa risons. It SHALL be ensured, that no reference of this biometric subject is already contained in the cache, e.g. by using the alphanumeric data from the identity document corresponding to the images.
	- **â¢** The oldest reference in the cache SHALL be deleted, if more than *n* references are currently stored in the cache. This maximum amount *n* of references in the cache SHALL be configurable.
	- **â¢** Additionally, cached references SHALL be deleted after a configurable time *t* in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations.
- f. The [FMRs](#page-89-16) for the zero-effort and all attributes based on yet evaluated data can be calculated ac cording to [Equation 3.8](#page-40-1).

5. The results are logged according to [FM Category Coding](#page-86-0) and [FM Category Logging.](#page-83-2)

## **3.12.2.2. Optional Measures to Enhance the Quality of the Evaluation**

For the assumptions made above to calculate the error rates, it is essential to ensure, that the correct mated reference template is (or is not) contained in the pool of reference templates. Following implementations MAY be used to achieve this goal:

- **â¢** For the accuracy evaluation of identifications or verifications using only one biometric modality, a pre ceding verification based on another biometric modality could give insight about the true nature (ma ted or non-mated) of the relation between probe and reference. As false-non-matches (or respectively fal se-matches) for different biometric modalities are independent, this does not introduce a bias. This is only possible if more biometric modalities are transmitted for the probe and are available for the references than required for the evaluation. Additionally, it MUST be ensured that the accuracy provided by verification of another modality is sufficiently high to prevent from introducing errors.
- **â¢** Further insight about the true nature (mated or non-mated) of the relation between probe and reference can be obtained by operator decisions from the main-workflow. Any non-match appearing during the border control process will require further inspection by an operator. The final decision entered by the operator can be used as additional information. If the operator ends this inspection by deciding on a true-non-match, the probe-reference pair SHOULD be excluded in evaluation workflows requiring mated pairs. Thus, the evaluation workflow itself will still be completely automatic, though its start SHALL be delayed until the main border control process is terminated, see [Figure 3.19.](#page-38-1)

For the process decision of expired [Entry-Exit System \(EES\)](#page-89-17) reference facial images, the following rule SHALL be applied. An [EES](#page-89-17) reference facial image SHALL be considered as expired if one of the following statements hold true for the [EES](#page-89-17) reference facial image:

- **â¢** if the age of biometric subject was *less than or equal to 12 years* at the create timestamps of the [EES](#page-89-17) reference facial image and the time range between the [EES](#page-89-17) reference facial image create timestamps and the current date is *greater than 1 year*
- **â¢** if the age of biometric subject was *greater than 12 years* at the create timestamps of the [EES](#page-89-17) reference facial image and the time range between the [EES](#page-89-17) reference image create timestamps and the current date is *greater than 3 years*

**Figure 3.28.** Partial Application Process Task "EES Biometric Update Fingerprints"

An update of [EES](#page-89-17) reference fingerprint SHALL be conducted according to [Table 3.2.](#page-53-0) In addition, a reasoning for the specified update rules will be amended in a next version of this Technical Guideline.

Note, that the following constraints have to be met by the update rules from a legislative point of view:

- **â¢** Right and left hand fingerprint images SHALL never be stored simultaneously in the [CS EES](#page-89-8).
- **â¢** If at least one finger of the right hand is available, the right hand slap SHALL be used, even if only one finger is available and four fingers of the left hand would be available.
- **â¢** A "best of" slap SHALL NOT be created, i.e. a slap stored with single fingers acquired in different acquisition processes.

In addition, the following constraint is set:

- **â¢** The quality of a fingerprint image is considered as sufficient if the quality score of the relevant finger excels a threshold. Update of fingerprints above the threshold SHALL NOT affect the update rules.
- **â¢** As many fingerprint images as possible of suitable quality SHALL be enrolled in the EES.
- **â¢** Information about the status of the missing fingers SHOULD be as accurate as possible.

For the decision whether the [EES](#page-89-17) reference fingerprints are of better quality compared to the live fingerprint, the [FM QA-FP-APP](#page-68-0) SHALL be applied.

**Table 3.2** Decision Table EES Reference Fingerprint Update

## **3.13.2.1. Annotations to Decision [Table 3.2](#page-53-0)**

The following annotations explain the reasoning behind the decision table. Each annotation refers to the cell of the decision table by its number.

- 1. If no fingerprints of the right hand are enrolled, though currently available, they SHALL be enrolled.
- 2. The reason for fingerprint images missing in the EES might change, e.g. from temporary missing fingers to permanently missing fingers. Therefore, an update is REQUIRED even if no fingerprint images can be ac quired. If no fingerprint images of the right hand are available, the left hand SHALL be used for enrolment.

<sup>12</sup> Note, if no [EES](#page-89-17) reference fingerprint is stored and at least one right live fingerprint is available, the acquisition of a left hand fingerprint SHALL NOT happen as it is not required for any purpose. Thus, no distinction between the case of *at least one live fingerprint available* and *no live fingerprint available* for left hand fingerprints is required

<sup>13</sup> Note, if at least one right [EES](#page-89-17) reference fingerprint is stored and at least one right live fingerprint is available, the acquisition of a left hand fingerprint SHALL NOT happen as it is not required for any purpose. Thus, no distinction between the case of *at least one live fingerprint available* and *no live fingerprint available* for left hand fingerprints is required

- 3. Following the aim to store as many fingerprint images of sufficient quality of the right hand as possible in the EES.
- 4. -
- 5. If no fingerprint images of the right hand are available, left SHALL be enrolment. As only fin gerprints of one hand must be enrolled in the EES, the right hand fingerprints SHALL be deleted and the missing reasons saved.
- 6. If no fingerprints of any hand are currently available, an update SHALL NOT be done as it would delete the currently enrolled fingerprint images. The only exception is the case, where all fingers of the right hand are now permanently missing. In this case, the fingerprint images of the right hand SHALL be deleted in the EES, as they can no longer be used for traveller verification. In this case, at least the reasons for the missing left fingers SHALL be enrolled.
- 7. Following the legal requirements, that the fingers of the right hand SHALL always be enrolled if possible.
- 8. -
- 9. If no fingerprints of any hand are currently available, an update SHALL NOT be done as it would delete the currently enrolled fingerprint images. The only exception is the case, where all fingers of the left hand are now permanently missing. In this case, the fingerprint images of the left hand SHALL be deleted in the EES, as they can no longer be used for traveller verification. In this case, at least the reasons for the missing right fingers SHALL be enrolled.

# <span id="page-56-0"></span>**4. Function Modules**

This chapter lists all Function Modules for the defined Application Profiles.

## <span id="page-56-3"></span><span id="page-56-1"></span>**4.1. FM Category Acquisition Hardware**

Devices that are used for digitising physical, representable biometric characteristics are called [Acquisition](#page-89-18) [Hardware \(AH\).](#page-89-18) Digital cameras to capture images of the face, fingerprint sensors, or signature tablets can be named as examples.

## <span id="page-56-2"></span>**4.1.1. FM AH-ALL-SSS**

This Function Module describes the requirements for [SSSs](#page-90-1) that are used to obtain digitised facial images and fingerprints.

## **4.1.1.1. Requirements**

#### **4.1.1.1.1. General Requirements**

- **â¢** An environment surveillance camera system SHALL supervise the area around the [SSS.](#page-90-1)
	- **â¢** The camera images SHALL allow to identify whether more than one person was in range of the [SSS](#page-90-1) during the capture of the fingerprints.
	- **â¢** The surveillance camera system SHALL capture an image of the surrounding area at the moment of each finger capture attempt. The face of the biometric subject using the fingerprint scanner SHALL be visible in the image of the surveillance camera.
	- **â¢** The images SHALL be cached locally on the [SSS.](#page-90-1)
	- **â¢** A maximum of 100 ms SHALL be allowed to elapse between the fingerprint capture attempt image and the capture of the surveillance camera system.
	- **â¢** For the fingerprint image selected in the acquisition process, the corresponding surveillance image SHALL be made available from the cache.
	- **â¢** A colour camera SHALL be used for the environment surveillance.
	- **â¢** The camera SHALL be capable to capture images with a resolution of at least 1280 x 720 pixels.
- **â¢** A camera system SHALL closely supervise the fingerprint capture system.
	- **â¢** The camera image is intended to identify whether presentation attack instruments are applied to the fingerprint capture system.
	- **â¢** The camera system SHALL capture an image of the fingerprint acquisition area at the moment of each finger capture attempt.
	- **â¢** The images SHALL be cached locally on the [SSS.](#page-90-1)
	- **â¢** A maximum of 100 ms SHALL be allowed to elapse between the fingerprint capture attempt image and the capture of the surveillance camera system.
	- **â¢** A colour camera SHALL be used for the fingerprint capture surveillance.
	- **â¢** The camera SHALL be capable to capture images with a resolution of at least 1280 x 720 pixels.

**â¢** In case the biometric subject leaves the corridor in front of the [SSS](#page-90-1) system, the running [SSS](#page-90-1) process SHALL be stopped. The corridor is defined by a distance of 100 cm in front of the [SSS](#page-90-1) and the width of the [SSS](#page-90-1). Note, this requirement does not mandate a dedicate hardware sensor to enable the detection of leaving. The detection MAY also happen in software based on the surveillance images. In this case, the requirement does not affect any additional hardware.

#### **4.1.1.2. Recommendations**

In case the biometric subject is approaching close to the maximum allowed distance of the [SSS](#page-90-1) the biometric subject SHOULD be warned.

## <span id="page-57-0"></span>**4.1.2. FM AH-FI-BCL**

This Function Module describes the requirements for systems where a digitised facial image is obtained. Note, the distance between camera system and biometric subject is defined as the geometrical optical-path length between the forehead of the biometric subject and the active camera system's optic. The optical-path MAY, for example, follow a straight line from forehead to optic, or be rerouted by using mirrors so that the biometric subject can stand closer to the device.

#### **4.1.2.1. Requirements**

- **â¢** The system MAY measure the distance between the biometric subject and the camera system.
- **â¢** The camera system SHALL capture images in colour.
- **â¢** The system SHALL allow high quality acquisitions independently from the environmental light situation.

None of the [CTF](#page-89-19) modulation values measured at specification spatial frequencies SHALL exceed 1.05. The output bar target image SHALL NOT exhibit any significant amount of aliasing. It is NOT REQUIRED that the bar target contains the exact frequencies listed in [Table 4.1,](#page-60-2) however, the target does need to cover the listed frequency range and contain bar patterns close to each of the listed frequencies.

The following equations are used to obtain the minimum acceptable [CTF](#page-89-19) modulation values when using bar targets that contain frequencies not listed in [Table 4.1](#page-60-2):

This Function Module describes requirements and interfaces for biometric image processing with respect to the output of (integrated) camera systems to obtain a facial image that fulfils the requirements.

#### **4.3.1.1. Requirements**

- **â¢** The colour depth SHALL be 24 bit sRGB. Note, this requirement is OPTIONAL for scenarios where only a facial verification is performed.
- **â¢** The face SHALL be fully visible in the foreground of the provided image.
- **â¢** The minimum distance between both eyes for capture positions of the biometric subject in the preferred area of the camera range SHALL be 120 pixels.
- **â¢** The face SHALL be cropped and de-rotated from the overall scene in the captured image. Post processing of the image orientation in regard to pitch and jaw (see [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-91-2)) SHALL NOT be done.
- **â¢** The size of the face within the image SHALL be according to the geometric requirements of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-91-2) and [QA](#page-90-4) category of this [TR.](#page-90-0)

## <span id="page-65-1"></span>**4.3.2. FM BIP-FP-APP**

This Function Module describes requirements and interfaces for the biometric image processing to provide up to four single finger images for the subsequent reference storage or biometric comparison.

#### **4.3.2.1. Requirements**

- **â¢** The resolution of the fingerprint image has to be 500 ppi or 1000 ppi corresponding to the certification requirements of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-91-4) and, therefore, MAY differ from the scan resolution.
- **â¢** Depending on the call, as many individual fingerprints as requested SHALL be extracted from the input image and provided as single fingerprints.

Note: Segmentation for single finger scanners is OPTIONAL.

For this segmentation process, the following requirements SHALL be fulfilled:

- **â¢** ability to accept fingerprints which are rotated in the same direction up to 45 degrees
- **â¢** in the same direction rotated fingerprints have to be corrected to be vertical
- **â¢** segment the first part over the finger (fingertip)
- **â¢** segmentation has to occur on uncompressed data
- **â¢** Fingerprint images SHALL NOT be upscaled. If the targeted system or database requires fingerprint images of higher size than captured the fingerprint image SHALL be evenly surrounded with white pixels to reach the desired size.

# <span id="page-65-0"></span>**4.4. FM Category Quality Assessment**

The Function Module [Quality Assessment contains all kinds of mechanisms and procedures to check the qua](#page-90-4) lity of the biometric data or to select the best quality data out of multiple instances.

## <span id="page-65-2"></span>**4.4.1. FM QA-FI-GENERIC**

This Function Module describes requirements and interfaces for software that is used for quality assessment of digital images to ensure compliance with [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\].](#page-91-2)

#### **4.4.1.1. Requirements**

#### **4.4.1.1.1. General Requirements**

The [QA](#page-90-4) module is used for the software-based automatic check of the conformance of the picture to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-91-2) after the digitisation. Thereby, the geometric properties of the picture as well as the digital parameters of the image are analysed and rated.

The standard which is relevant for the quality of facial images [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\] hierarchically describes requi](#page-91-2) rements for the facial images. In the following, full frontal images are expected.

The [QA](#page-90-4) module SHALL analyse and evaluate all of the quality criteria listed in [Table 4.2](#page-66-0). For the criteria marked with "M", the quality values SHALL be provided while quality values for the criteria marked with "O" MAY be provided in the defined format according to the respective criteria.

A criterion is fulfilled if its calculated value is in the given threshold boundaries.

Based on the results of all provided quality criteria the [QA](#page-90-4) module SHALL reject or approve the picture. The total result is true if every single quality criteria is fulfilled.

The [QA](#page-90-4) module SHALL provide an interface for conformance testing where a single image can be processed and the calculated values and configuration data are returned. The image type to process depends on the image type requirements of the application profile to implement.

The [QA](#page-90-4) module SHOULD operate on cropped images retrieved from the image processing according to [FM](#page-64-0) [Category Biometric Image Processing.](#page-64-0)

**Table 4.2** Mapping of Relevant Quality Criteria

#### **4.4.1.1.2. Identification of the Best Capture**

When multiple facial images and their corresponding set of quality metrics are present, the best capture of the list SHALL be identified in an automated manner as described in the following[2](#page-67-1) :

- 1. If exactly one facial image conforms to more mandatory criteria than all other images, this image is chosen.
- 2. If more than one facial image is conform to more mandatory criteria than all other facial images, the facial image fulfilling the most optional criteria SHALL be chosen.
- 3. If more than one facial image is conform to more mandatory and optional criteria than all other facial images, the most recent facial image within this selection SHALL be chosen. If no timestamp is available, a random selection MAY be applied among the facial images fulfilling the most criteria.

**Table 4.3** Quality Threshold Requirements for Facial Images for Border Control

## <span id="page-68-1"></span>**4.4.3. FM QA-FI-PRE**

This Function Module describes quality requirements for a digital live facial image that is used for automated face recognition (pre-qualification).

#### **4.4.3.1. Requirements**

- **â¢** Pre-qualification of captured live facial images from the acquisition stream SHALL be used. Images SHALL be ranked according to the conducted pre-qualification and passed to the subsequent stage as indicated by the rank.
- **â¢** Pre-qualification SHALL be conducted at least according to the following criteria, refer to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FACE\]](#page-91-2):
	- **â¢** pose of the head
	- **â¢** illumination of the face
	- **â¢** position of the eyes
- **â¢** The pre-qualification result SHALL depend only on the provided live-captured facial image. In particular, the pre-qualification SHALL be independet of any other biometric sample that might be extracted from other sources, e.g. [eMRTD](#page-89-9), etc.

## <span id="page-68-0"></span>**4.4.4. FM QA-FP-APP**

This Function Module describes requirements for the quality assessment of plain or rolled fingerprints inclu ding quality assessment of single fingerprint, respectively slap and selection of the best quality image out of multiple instances.

## **4.4.4.1. Requirements**

#### **4.4.4.1.1. Quality Algorithm**

As quality algorithm, the latest version of [NIST Fingerprint Image Quality 2.2 \(NFIQ2.2\)](#page-89-22) [\[BIB\\_NFIQ2.2\]](#page-91-6) SHALL be used, and therefore, images with 1000 ppi SHALL be resampled to 500 ppi before application of [NFIQ2.2](#page-89-22). Note, that the resampled image SHALL be used for [NFIQ2.2](#page-89-22) only. As resulting quality value, the output value of [NFIQ2.2](#page-89-22) in the integer range of [0,100] SHALL be used. In the case of failure, the returned error code 255 indicates that a computation was not successful and the resulting quality value SHALL be returned as the result, as described in [Section 4.11.1](#page-83-1).

#### **4.4.4.1.2. Quality Evaluation Process for a Slap or Single Fingerprint**

In case a single captured fingerprint, respectively slap is passed, the [QA](#page-90-4) SHALL be performed as described in the following. Beforehand, the fingerprints of the passed capture SHALL be segmented (considering missing fingers). Note, that in verification applications, a [QA](#page-90-4) is not conducted. Thus, every slap capture is considered sufficient and no thresholds are specified here. Skipping the [QA](#page-90-4) is expected to accelerate the overall process. OPTIONALLY, a [QA](#page-90-4) can be performed.

1. For each segmented fingerprint *FA;j* of a passed capture *A*, a quality value *QA;j* is calculated with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 (up to 4 fingers in one slap) representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FIN](#page-91-4) [GER\].](#page-91-4)

- 2. The resulting quality value is compared with the defined threshold *T Hj* for this finger. The application specific thresholds as defined in the following section apply.
- 3. In case all of the fingerprint qualities reach the specified threshold (i.e. *8j; QA;j Â¸ T Hj* ), the boolean infor mation *b* = 1 indicates a successful capture.
- 4. In case one or more fingerprints do not reach the threshold (i.e. *9j; QA;j < T Hj* ), the boolean information *b* = 0 indicates insufficient quality of the capture.
- 5. For the segmented fingerprint *FA;j* the corresponding parameter set *PA;j* is compiled and returned.
- 6. As a result of the [QA](#page-90-4) process, the following values are returned to the calling process:
	- a. the boolean information *b*
	- b. the parameter set *PA* = *QA;j ; :::; QA;l* with *j; l 2* 1*; :::;* 10 representing the specific finger code

#### **4.4.4.1.3. Identification of the Best Capture out of Multiple Captures**

When multiple captures *Ai ;i 2* 1*; :::; n* and their corresponding set of segmented fingerprints *FAi ;j* with *j 2* 1*; :::;* 10 representing the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-91-4) are passed, the best of the captures SHALL be identified as described in the following section:

- 1. For each segmented fingerprint *FAi ;j* of a passed capture *Ai* , the quality value *QAi ;j* is calculated with re presenting the specific finger code according to [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_FINGER\]](#page-91-4).
- 2. The captures are ranked according to the quality values of the fingerprints according to the following (lexicographical) order. The highest ranked capture is considered as the capture yielding the best quality.
	- a. for left/right four-finger slaps, the order is as follows:
		- i. index finger (highest priority)
		- ii. middle finger
		- iii. ring finger
		- iv. little finger (lowest priority)

Example 1: Two Slaps of a right hand. Middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the first slap have a better quality than the middle finger, ring finger and little finger of the second slap, but the quality of the index finger is better in the second slap. Consequently, the second slap SHALL be taken.

Example 2: Three Slaps of a left hand. The quality of the index finger and the middle finger is the same in all three slaps, but the quality of the ring finger is better in the first slap. So the first slap SHALL be taken, no matter how high or low the quality of the little finger is in any slap.

- b. for thumb slaps, the order is as follows:
	- i. right thumb (highest priority)
	- ii. left thumb (lowest priority)
- c. for index finger slaps:
	- i. In contrast to the other two slap types, the best capture of index finger slaps is a set of the best captures of each index finger as indicated by the following two options.

If each index finger yields sufficient quality in at least one of the already conducted captures, the index fingers of sufficient quality are accepted and the total index finger slap capture is considered as of sufficient quality.

If not both index fingers yield at least once sufficient quality in a capture, the best image for each index finger is returned as the best capture and the slap captured is considered as of insufficient quality.

- ii. If for a single slap both index fingers yield to sufficient quality, those two index fingers SHALL be selected even if an index finger of another slap yield to better quality.
- d. for rolled single finger captures:
	- i. Of the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand, which are not annotated by a hardware reported issue, the capture with the highest quality value is considered as the best image.
	- ii. If the set of captured images obtained in the process beforehand on does only contain images which are annotated by hardware reported issues, the capture with the highest quality value of the entire set is considered as the best image.
	- iii. In case several captures yield to the same highest quality value, the last (temporal) of highest quality captures is considered as the best image.
- 3. As a result of the [QA](#page-90-4) process, the following values are returned:
	- a. the identifier *i* representing the capture yielding the best quality
	- b. the parameter set *PA* = *QAi;j ; QAi;l* with *j; l 2* 1*; :::*10.

#### **4.4.4.1.4. Thresholds for Plain Fingerprints for Enrolment Purposes**

The following thresholds as indicated in [Table 4.4](#page-70-0) apply when fingerprints are captured plain for enrolment purposes. Note, the thresholds in [Table 4.4](#page-70-0) do not apply to plain captured fingerprint in enrolment scenarios where the plain fingerprints are captured for control purpose of rolled fingerprints. In that case, thresholds as indicated in [Table 4.5](#page-71-2) apply for the plain fingerprints.

## <span id="page-71-1"></span>**4.5.1. FM PAD-FI-APP**

This Function Module describes requirements for [PAD](#page-89-7) in the context of the acquisition of facial images. This Function Module is especially relevant for use cases where no direct observation of the acquisition process by an operator is possible (e.g. in [SSS](#page-90-1) scenarios).

## **4.5.1.1. Requirements**

#### **4.5.1.1.1. General Requirements**

The capture subsystem SHALL contain a [PAD](#page-89-7) subsystem detecting spoofing attempts using artefacts by which an attacker is trying to establish a different biometric characteristic as probe in the verification or identifica tion process.

The [PAD](#page-89-7) subsystem SHALL be able to detect different artefact classes listed in the following:

- **â¢** Complete artefacts (covering the whole or nearly the whole face of the attacker), either built from one piece or from multiple pieces.
- **â¢** Partial artefacts (covering only parts of the attacker's face, such as artefacts covering the chin only), either built from one piece or from multiple pieces.

The [PAD](#page-89-7) subsystem SHALL be able to detect all well-known artefact material types listed in the following:

- **â¢** Photographs printed on paper with different thicknesses and structures of paper and different structures of printing (colouring, etc.).

- **â¢** Additional artefacts beyond the imitation of faces, such as glasses etc.

Under optimal testing conditions, the [PAD](#page-89-7) subsystem SHALL feature a false-alarm-rate of 2% maximum when tested with bona fide biometric subjects. This rate is monitored via logfiles analysis within the operational environment. If this rate is significantly exceeded, any certification that may have been issued might be reevaluated (depending on application context)[3](#page-72-0) .

Also, the detection subsystem SHALL be adequate to the usage setting in correspondence with the security requirements in question. The performance MAY be described by a risk analysis for every considered attack type. The current version of [\[BIB\\_ISO\\_PAD\\_3\]](#page-91-7) SHALL be taken into account.

A binary score SHALL NOT be used (e.g. True or False, 1 or 0). Detailed information about the [PAD](#page-89-7) (results) SHALL be logged as described in [Section 4.12](#page-86-0). The technical information including the result value and description of the mapping between technical result and interpretation SHALL be stored additionally, if they are provided.

Even if the Function Module is used within a comparison scenario, the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case, independent from any biometric comparison score. Also, the omission of the detection result SHALL be signalled in any case.

The [PAD](#page-89-7) result SHALL correspond to the chosen facial image.

Note that a facial image SHALL be taken independently of a possible PAD alarm.

#### **4.5.1.1.3. Maintenance Requirements**

The [PAD](#page-89-7) subsystem SHALL be independent of the regular capture subsystem.

It SHALL signal its detection results in the form of a [PAD](#page-89-7) score for each finger individually. Additionally, an overall result SHALL be returned to the calling application.

The score for each finger SHALL be a normalized as double in the range [0,1] using at least ten uniformly distributed interim values, where 0 indicates bona fide and 1 presentation attack.

## <span id="page-86-2"></span>**4.12.2. FM COD-ALL-EES**

This Function Module describes requirements and interfaces for the coding of general information according to EES-ANSI-NIST transactions.

## **4.12.2.1. Requirements**

The general coding SHALL be conformant to the current version of the [\[BIB\\_EES\\_ICD\]](#page-91-12) in the binary format. Some required EES-ANSI-NIST data fields (e.g. biographic information) may not be available for the acquisi tion system (see [Table 4.9](#page-86-3)) . In order to keep the schema conformance during the entire process, these fields SHALL be filled with conformant placeholders. These placeholders SHALL be replaced as soon as possible with the actual values by the calling application.
